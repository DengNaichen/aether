The baking soda reacts with acetic acid in the vinegar to produce carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas helps the batter rise. The chemical equation for this reaction is

$$
\mathrm {N a H C O} _ {3 (\mathrm {s})} + \mathrm {C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {N a C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\ell)} + \mathrm {C O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})}
$$

According to the balanced equation, one molecule of baking soda reacts with one molecule of acetic acid to form a salt, water, and carbon dioxide.

The head of a pin, made primarily of iron, has a mass of about $8 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~g}$, yet it contains about $8 \times 10^{19}$ atoms. The mass of a single iron atom is about $1 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{~g}$.

**Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses**

The mass of an atom is expressed in atomic mass units (u). Atomic mass units are a relative measure, defined by the mass of carbon-12. One atom of carbon-12 is assigned a mass of $12\mathrm{u}$. Stated another way, $1\mathrm{u} = \frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

The masses of all other atoms are defined by their relationship to carbon-12. For example, oxygen-16 has a mass that is $133\%$ of the mass of carbon-12. Hence the mass of an atom of oxygen-16 is

$$
\frac {1 3 3}{1 0 0} \times 1 2. 0 0 0 \mathrm {u} = 1 6. 0 \mathrm {u}.
$$

Atoms of the same element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up of two or more isotopes.

**Isotopic Abundance**

Magnesium has three naturally occurring isotopes: $79\%$ magnesium-24, $10\%$ magnesium-25, and $11\%$ magnesium-26. This proportion is constant regardless of the source of magnesium. The relative amount in which each isotope is present in an element is called the isotopic abundance. It can be expressed as a percent or as a decimal fraction.

Magnesium plays a variety of roles in the body. It is involved in energy production, nerve function, and muscle relaxation. The magnesium in these tablets, like all naturally occurring magnesium, is made up of three isotopes.

**Average Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table**

The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses of all the element's isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of each isotope within the element. The average atomic mass is the mass that is given for each element in the periodic table.

The average atomic mass of carbon is $12.01\mathrm{u}$. No one atom of carbon has a mass of $12.01\mathrm{u}$. Carbon is made up of several isotopes: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. Carbon-12 comprises $98.9\%$ of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for $1.1\%$. Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount—about $1 \times 10^{-10}\%$. The average mass of all the isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u, which is very close to 12, since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.

The only elements with only one naturally occurring isotope are beryllium, sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus.

Chemists use a mass spectrometer, a powerful instrument that generates a magnetic field, to obtain data about the mass and abundance of atoms and molecules.

**Working with Weighted Averages**

A weighted average takes into account not only the values associated with a set of data, but also the abundance or importance of each value.

To calculate the average of a set of data with equal weight, you add the given values and divide the total by the number of values in the set. For example, for objects A (1.0 kg), B (2.0 kg), and C (3.0 kg), the equally weighted average mass is:
$\frac {1 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 . 0 \mathrm {k g}}{3} = 2. 0 \mathrm {k g}$

For a set containing two of A, one of B, and three of C, the weighted average mass is:
$\frac {2 (1 . 0 \mathrm {k g}) + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 (3 . 0 \mathrm {k g})}{6} = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}$

Alternatively, considering relative abundance: A is $\frac{2}{6}$ (33%), B is $\frac{1}{6}$ (17%), and C is $\frac{3}{6}$ (50%). The average mass is:
$(0. 3 3) (1. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 1 7) (2. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 5 0) (3. 0 \mathrm {k g}) = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}$

**Calculating Average Atomic Mass**

If the atomic mass of each isotope and its isotopic abundance are known, the average atomic mass of the element can be calculated.

For example, lithium exists as two isotopes: lithium-7 (mass 7.015 u, $92.58\%$ abundance) and lithium-6 (mass 6.015 u, $7.42\%$ abundance). The average atomic mass of lithium is calculated as:
$\left(\frac {9 2 . 5 8}{1 0 0}\right) (7. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) + \left(\frac {7 . 4 2}{1 0 0}\right) (6. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) = 6. 9 4 \mathrm {u}$
The periodic table confirms the average atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 u.

**The Mass Spectrometer**

Mass spectrometers can detect trace pollutants, provide information about large molecules, and help determine the age of Earth's oldest rocks. They find the relative abundance of each isotope in an element. J.J. Thompson first detected neon-20 and neon-22 in 1912 using a magnetic field to separate isotopes.

Today's mass spectrometers also use a magnetic field to separate ions. Atoms must first be charged, or "ionized," because a magnetic field only affects charged particles. The magnetic field then deflects ions with the same charge but different masses onto separate paths. Lighter ions curve more than heavier ions.

Elements that are not gases are vaporized by heating. Gas atoms are then ionized, typically by electron impact ionization, where electrons from a heated filament collide with gas atoms, causing them to lose an electron and become positive ions.

The ions are focused and accelerated by electric fields toward a magnetic field. The magnetic field deflects them, forcing them into a curved path. Ions from different isotopes arrive at different destinations. A detector registers the current at each destination, which is proportional to the number of ions. An isotope with a larger relative abundance generates a larger current. From these currents, chemists deduce the proportion of each isotope.

Mass spectral data for neon show the relative abundance of its isotopes. Chemists now detect neon-21, in addition to neon-20 and neon-22.

**Example: Average Atomic Mass Calculation**
Naturally occurring silver exists as two isotopes: $^{107}_{47}\mathrm{Ag}$ (106.9 u, 51.8% abundance) and $^{109}_{47}\mathrm{Ag}$ (108.9 u, 48.2% abundance).
Average atomic mass of $\mathrm{Ag} = 106.9\mathrm{u}(0.518) + 108.9\mathrm{u}(0.482) = 107.9 \mathrm {u}$.
The periodic table shows the average atomic mass of silver as 107.9 u.

**Fact about Atomic Masses**
The atomic masses of individual isotopes are not exact whole numbers (except for carbon-12). Protons and neutrons have masses close to, but slightly different from, 1 u. The mass of electrons, though much smaller, must also be taken into account.

**Calculating Isotopic Abundance**

Knowing the average atomic mass of an element and the masses of its isotopes, the isotopic abundances can be calculated.

**Example: Isotopic Abundance Calculation**
Boron exists as two naturally occurring isotopes: ${}^{10}_{5}\mathrm{B}$ (10.01 u) and ${}^{11}_{5}\mathrm{B}$ (11.01 u). The average atomic mass of boron is 10.81 u.
Let the abundance of boron-10 be $x$ and boron-11 be $1-x$.
Average atomic mass $= x$ (atomic mass B-10) + $(1 - x)$ (atomic mass B-11)
$10.81 = x (10.01) + (1 - x) (11.01)$
$10.81 = 10.01x + 11.01 - 11.01x$
$11.01x - 10.01x = 11.01 - 10.81$
$x = 0.2000$
The abundance of boron-10 is 0.2000 (20.00%).
The abundance of boron-11 is $1 - 0.2000 = 0.8000$ (80.00%).
This makes sense because the average atomic mass (10.81 u) is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.

Boron is part of boric acid, $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{BO}_3$, which is contained in many cleaning solutions for contact lenses.

In some periodic tables, the average atomic mass is referred to as the atomic weight of an element.

**The Avogadro Constant and the Mole**

Chemical reactions depend on the number of atoms present, not on their masses. Since atoms are too small and numerous to count individually, a way to relate the numbers of atoms to measurable masses is needed.

**The Definition of the Mole**

Chemists use the mole (symbol mol) to group atoms and molecules.
- One mole (1 mol) of a substance contains $6.022 141 99 \times 10^{23}$ particles of the substance. This value is called the Avogadro constant, symbol $N_{\mathrm{A}}$.
- The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or formula units) as exactly $12\mathrm{g}$ of carbon-12.

For example, one mole of carbon contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ atoms of C. One mole of sodium chloride contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ formula units of NaCl. One mole of hydrofluoric acid contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of HF.

The Avogadro constant is an experimentally determined quantity.

**The Chemist's Dozen**

The mole is analogous to a "dozen" for chemists. Just as 2 dozen eggs means 24 eggs, 2 mol of aluminum atoms contain $2 \times (6.02 \times 10^{23}) = 1.20 \times 10^{24}$ atoms of Al.

**How Big Is the Avogadro Constant?**

The Avogadro constant is a huge number ($6.02 \times 10^{23}$). This magnitude is necessary to group single atoms into convenient amounts.
Samples of elements containing $1.00\mathrm{mol}$ or $6.02\times 10^{23}$ atoms have different masses.

**Example: Using the Avogadro Constant**
The distance from St. John's to Vancouver is $5046\mathrm{km}$. A round trip is $10092\mathrm{km}$.
If 1 mol of peas, each of diameter 1 cm, were laid end to end, how many round trips could be made?
Round trip distance in cm: $(10092 \mathrm{km}) \times (10^5 \mathrm{cm/km}) = 1.01 \times 10^9 \mathrm{cm}$.
Length of 1 mol of peas: $6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}$.
Number of round trips $= \frac {6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {c m}}{\left(1 . 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {9} \mathrm {c m} / \text {r o u n d t r i p}\right)} = 5. 9 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 4} \mathrm {r o u n d t r i p s}$.
About 596 trillion round trips could be made.

**Converting Moles to Number of Particles**

The relationship between moles, number of particles, and the Avogadro constant is:
$N = n \times N_{\mathrm{A}}$
where $N$ is the number of particles, $n$ is the number of moles, and $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the Avogadro constant ($6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles/mol).

**Example: Moles to Atoms**
A sample contains $1.25\mathrm{mol}$ of nitrogen dioxide, $\mathrm{NO}_2$.
(a) Number of molecules in the sample:
$(1. 2 5 \mathrm {m o l}) \times \left(6. 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \frac {\text {m o l e c u l e s}}{\mathrm {m o l}}\right) = 7. 5 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}$.
(b) Number of atoms in the sample (each $\mathrm{NO}_2$ molecule has 3 atoms):
$(7.52 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{molecules}) \times \left(3 \frac{\mathrm{atoms}}{\mathrm{molecule}}\right) = 2.26 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{atoms}$.

**Converting Number of Particles to Moles**

Chemists typically use units of moles to express amounts of substances. To convert the number of particles in a substance to the number of moles, the equation is rearranged:
$n = \frac {N}{N _ {\mathrm {A}}}$

**Example: Molecules to Moles**
How many moles are present in a sample of carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, made up of $5.83 \times 10^{24}$ molecules?
$n = \frac {5 . 8 3 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s C O} _ {2}}{\left(6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s C O} _ {2} / \mathrm {m o l C O} _ {2}\right)} = 9. 6 8 \mathrm {m o l} \mathrm {C O} _ {2}$.

The Avogadro constant is named to honour the Italian chemist Amedeo Avogadro. In 1811, Avogadro postulated Avogadro's law: Equal volumes of gases, at equal temperatures and pressures, contain the same number of molecules.

**Molar Mass**

One atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly $12\mathrm{u}$. By definition, one mole of carbon-12 atoms ($6.02\times 10^{23}$ carbon-12 atoms) has a mass of exactly $12\mathrm{g}$.
The Avogadro constant is the factor that converts the relative mass of individual atoms or molecules, expressed in atomic mass units, to mole quantities, expressed in grams.

The periodic table gives the average mass of a single atom in atomic mass units (u). One mole of an element has a mass expressed in grams numerically equivalent to the element's average atomic mass expressed in atomic mass units. For example, zinc has an average atomic mass of 65.39 u, so one mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g.

The mass of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass (symbol $M$). Molar mass is expressed in g/mol. For example, the average atomic mass of gold is 196.97 u, so gold's molar mass is 196.97 g/mol.

**Table: Average Atomic Mass and Molar Mass of Four Elements**
| Element        | Average atomic mass (u) | Molar mass (g/mol) |
| :------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------- |
| hydrogen, H    | 1.01                    | 1.01               |
| oxygen, O      | 16.00                   | 16.00              |
| sodium, Na     | 22.99                   | 22.99              |
| argon, Ar      | 39.95                   | 39.95              |

**Finding the Molar Mass of Compounds**

To find the molar mass of a compound, add the molar masses of each element it contains, multiplied by their respective subscripts in the chemical formula.
For example, 1 mol of beryllium oxide, BeO, contains 1 mol of beryllium and 1 mol of oxygen.
$M _ {\mathrm {B e O}} = 9. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} + 1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} = 2 5. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and most other standardization bodies use $M$ to represent molar mass.

**Example: Molar Mass of a Compound**
What is the mass of one mole of calcium phosphate, $\mathrm{Ca}_3(\mathrm{PO}_4)_2$?
The formula indicates 3 mol of calcium, 2 mol of phosphorus, and 8 mol of oxygen.
$M _ {\mathrm {C a}} \times 3 = (4 0. 0 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 3 = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {P}} \times 2 = (3 0. 9 7 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 2 = 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {O}} \times 8 = (1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 8 = 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {C a} _ {3} (\mathrm {P O} _ {4}) _ {2}} = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g / m o l} = 3 1 0. 1 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$.
The molar mass of calcium phosphate is $310.18\mathrm{g / mol}$.

**Counting Particles Using Mass**

One mole of any compound or element contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles. The compound or element has a mass, in grams, determined from the periodic table.
For carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$: $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 1$ mol of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 44.0\mathrm{g}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
The molar mass relates the amount of an element or a compound, in moles, to its mass. The Avogadro constant relates the number of particles to the molar amount.

**Converting from Moles to Mass**

The equation used to solve problems involving mass, molar mass, and number of moles is:
Mass = Number of moles $\times$ Molar mass
$m = n \times M$

**Example: Moles to Mass**
A flask contains $0.750 \, \mathrm{mol}$ of carbon dioxide gas, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. What mass of carbon dioxide gas is in this sample?
Molar mass of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} = (2 \times 16.00 \mathrm{g/mol}) + 12.01 \mathrm{g/mol} = 44.01 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
$m = (0. 7 5 0 \mathrm {mol}) \times (4 4. 0 1 \mathrm {g / mol}) = 3 3. 0 \mathrm {g}$.
The mass of $0.75\mathrm{mol}$ of carbon dioxide is $33.0\mathrm{g}$.

**Converting from Mass to Moles**

To calculate the number of moles in a sample, divide the mass of the sample by its molar mass.
$n = \frac {m}{M}$

**Example: Mass to Moles**
How many moles of acetic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$, are in a $23.6\mathrm{g}$ sample?
The molar mass of $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$ is $(12.01 \times 2) + (16.00 \times 2) + (1.01 \times 4) = 60.06 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
$n = \frac {2 3 . 6 \mathrm {g}}{6 0 . 0 6 \mathrm {g / m o l}} = 0. 3 9 3 \mathrm {m o l}$.
There are $0.393\mathrm{mol}$ of acetic acid in $23.6\mathrm{g}$ of acetic acid.

**Chemical Amounts in Vitamin Supplements**
Vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) regulate metabolism, build blood and bone, and maintain muscles and nerves. Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) outlines daily micronutrient amounts.
The form of a mineral in supplements affects its bioavailability. For example, $650\mathrm{mg}$ of calcium carbonate, $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$, contains $260\mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium. The same amount of calcium gluconate contains $58\mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium.

Quality control (QC) chemists in multivitamin manufacturing analyze raw materials using standardized tests (e.g., US Pharmacopoeia). They prepare samples and standard solutions, then compare them using techniques like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which produces a "fingerprint" spectrum for compound identification. Tablets and capsules are also tested for dissolution and disintegration properties.

**Converting Between Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles**

The relationships among the number of particles, number of moles, and mass of a substance allow conversion between these values.
To convert between particles, moles, and mass:
- Particles to Moles: Divide by Avogadro constant ($N_{\mathrm{A}}$).
- Moles to Mass: Multiply by Molar Mass ($M$).
- Mass to Moles: Divide by Molar Mass ($M$).
- Moles to Particles: Multiply by Avogadro constant ($N_{\mathrm{A}}$).

**Example: Particles to Mass**
What is the mass of $5.67 \times 10^{24}$ molecules of cobalt(II) chloride, $\mathrm{CoCl}_2$?
Molar mass of $\mathrm{CoCl}_2 = 58.93 \mathrm{g/mol} + (2 \times 35.45 \mathrm{g/mol}) = 129.83 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
Mass $= \frac {5 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \mathrm {molecules-CoCl_2}}{6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {molecules-CoCl_2 / mol-CoCl_2}} \times 1 2 9. 8 3 \mathrm {g CoCl_2 / mol-CoCl_2} = 1. 2 2 \times 1 0 ^ {3} \mathrm {g CoCl_2}$.

**Example: Mass to Particles**
How many molecules of iodine chloride, ICl, are contained in a $2.74 \times 10^{-1}$ g sample?
Molar mass of ICl $= 126.90 \mathrm{g/mol} + 35.45 \mathrm{g/mol} = 162.35 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
Moles of ICl $= \frac {2 . 7 4 \times 1 0 ^ {- 1} \mathrm {g}}{1 6 2 . 3 5 \mathrm {g / m o l}} = 1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l}$.
Number of molecules $= (1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l}) \times \frac {(6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s})}{1 \mathrm {m o l}} = 1. 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {2 1} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}$.
