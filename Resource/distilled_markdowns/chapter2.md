Helium, unlike hydrogen, does not burn. In fact, helium is a highly unreactive gas. The answer to why hydrogen is reactive and helium is unreactive lies in the structure of the atoms of these elements.

Elements are the basic substances that make up all matter. About 90 elements exist naturally in the universe. The two smallest and least dense of these elements are hydrogen and helium. Yet hydrogen and helium account for nearly $98\%$ of the mass of the entire universe!

Regardless of abundance, any two samples of hydrogen—from anywhere on Earth or far beyond in outer space—are identical to each other. This is because each element is made up of only a single kind of atom. For example, the element hydrogen contains only hydrogen atoms. The element helium contains only helium atoms.

# The Atomic Theory of Matter

John Dalton described atoms as solid, indestructible particles that make up all matter.

# Dalton's Atomic Theory (1809)

- All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. An atom cannot be created, destroyed, or divided into smaller particles.
- The atoms of one element cannot be converted into the atoms of any another element.
- All the atoms of one element have the same properties, such as mass and size. These properties are different from the properties of the atoms of any other element.
- Atoms of different elements combine in specific proportions to form compounds.

# The Modern View of the Atom

An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still retains the identity and properties of the element.
An average atom is about $10^{-10}$ m in diameter.
Atoms themselves are made up of even smaller particles. These subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons cluster together to form the central core, or nucleus, of an atom. Fast-moving electrons occupy the space that surrounds the nucleus of the atom. Subatomic particles are associated with electrical charges.

Table 2.1 Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

| Subatomic particle | Charge | Symbol | Mass (in g)        | Radius (in m)      |
| :----------------- | :----- | :----- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| electron           | 1-     | e-     | 9.02 × 10⁻²⁸       | smaller than 10⁻¹⁸ |
| proton             | 1+     | p+     | 1.67 × 10⁻²⁴       | 10⁻¹⁵              |
| neutron            | 0      | n0     | 1.67 × 10⁻²⁴       | 10⁻¹⁵              |

# Expressing the Mass of Subatomic Particles

One proton or neutron has a mass of $1.66 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{~g}$.
Chemists use a unit called an atomic mass unit (symbol $\mathbf{u}$). A proton has a mass of about $1\mathrm{u}$, which is equal to $1.66\times 10^{-24}\mathrm{g}$.
The number $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ is called the Avogadro constant.

The atomic theory was a convincing explanation of the behaviour of matter. It explained two established scientific laws: the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite composition.

- Law of conservation of mass: During a chemical reaction, the total mass of the substances involved does not change.
- Law of definite proportion: Elements always combine to form compounds in fixed proportions by mass. (For example, pure water always contains the elements hydrogen and oxygen, combined in the following proportions: $11\%$ hydrogen and $89\%$ oxygen.)

A proton is about 1837 times more massive than an electron. The mass of an electron is $9.02 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~g}$. This value is so small that scientists consider the mass of an electron to be approximately equal to zero. Thus, electrons are not taken into account when calculating the mass of an atom.

# The Nucleus of an Atom

All the atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nucleus. Chemists use the term atomic number (symbol $Z$) to refer to the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of an element.
An element's mass number (symbol $A$) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of one of its atoms. Each proton or neutron is counted as one unit of the mass number.
Information about an element's protons and neutrons is often summarized using chemical notation:
$^{A}_{Z}\mathrm{X}$
where X represents the atomic symbol for an element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.
The number of neutrons can be calculated by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number:
Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number
$= A - Z$

# Using the Atomic Number to Infer the Number of Electrons

The atoms of each element are electrically neutral. This means that their positive charges (protons) and negative charges (electrons) must balance one another. In other words, in the neutral atom of any element, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons.

# Isotopes and Atomic Mass

The number of neutrons can vary. Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
The isotopes of an element have very similar chemical properties because they have the same number of protons and electrons. They differ in mass, however, because they have different numbers of neutrons.
Some isotopes are more unstable than others. Their nuclei are more likely to decay, releasing energy and subatomic particles. This process, called radioactivity, happens spontaneously. Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes for short, have unstable nuclei. Many isotopes are not radioactive isotopes.
Radioisotopes decay because their nuclei are unstable. The time it takes for nuclei to decay varies greatly.

# Electrons in Atoms

Electrons occupy the space surrounding the nucleus. They are the first subatomic particles that are likely to interact when atoms come near one another. The number and arrangement of the electrons in an atom determine how the atom will react, if at all, with other atoms. Valence electrons are responsible for the chemical properties of the elements.

# Revisiting the Atomic Theory

The modern atomic theory retains many of Dalton's ideas, with only a few modifications:

- All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom is made up of smaller subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. (Modification: Although an atom is divisible, it is still the smallest particle of an element that has the properties and identity of the element.)
- The atoms of one element cannot be converted into the atoms of any another element by a chemical reaction. (Modification: Nuclear reactions (changes that alter the composition of the atomic nucleus) may, in fact, convert atoms of one element into atoms of another.)
- Atoms of one element have the same properties, such as average mass and size. These properties are different from the properties of the atoms of any other element. (Modification: Different isotopes of an element have different numbers of neutrons and thus different masses. Scientists treat elements as if their atoms have an average mass.)
- Atoms of different elements combine in specific proportions to form compounds. (This idea has remained basically unchanged.)

# 2.2 Atoms, Elements, and the Periodic Table

The term periodic means "repeating in an identifiable pattern."
One chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907), sequenced the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass. The result was a table of the elements, organized so that elements with similar properties were arranged in the same column. Because Mendeleev's arrangement highlighted periodic (repeating) patterns of properties, it was called a periodic table.
The modern periodic table is a modification of the arrangement first proposed by Mendeleev. Instead of organizing elements according to atomic mass, the modern periodic table organizes elements according to atomic number. According to the periodic law, the chemical and physical properties of the elements repeat in a regular, periodic pattern when they are arranged according to their atomic number.

# Key features of the modern periodic table:

- Each element is in a separate box, with its atomic number, atomic symbol, and atomic mass.
- Elements are arranged in seven numbered periods (horizontal rows) and 18 numbered groups (vertical columns).
- Groups are numbered according to two different systems: 1 to 18 (current) and I to VIII (older, with A and B categories).
- The elements in the eight A groups are the main-group elements, also called the representative elements.
- The elements in the ten B groups are known as the transition elements.
- Within the B group transition elements are two horizontal series of elements called inner transition elements. They usually appear below the main periodic table, fitting between the elements in Group 3 (IIIB) and Group 4 (IVB).
- A bold "staircase" line runs from the top of Group 13 (IIIA) to the bottom of Group 16 (VIA). This line separates the elements into three broad classes: metals, metalloids (or semi-metals), and non-metals.
- Group 1 (IA) elements are known as alkali metals. They react with water to form alkaline, or basic, solutions.
- Group 2 (IIA) elements are known as alkaline earth metals. They react with oxygen to form compounds called oxides, which react with water to form alkaline solutions.
- Group 17 (VIIA) elements are known as halogens, from the Greek word hals, meaning "salt." Elements in this group combine with other elements to form compounds called salts.
- Group 18 (VIII.A) elements are known as noble gases. Noble gases do not combine in nature with any other elements.

# Electrons and Energy Levels

Electrons cannot move haphazardly. Their movement around an atomic nucleus is restricted to fixed regions of space. These regions are three-dimensional, similar to the layers of an onion. These regions are called energy levels. An electron that is moving in a lower energy level is close to the nucleus. It has less energy than it would if it were moving in a higher energy level.
There is a limit to the number of electrons that can occupy each energy level. For example, a maximum of two electrons can occupy the first energy level. A maximum of eight electrons can occupy the second energy level.
A common way to show the arrangement of electrons in an atom is to draw circles around the atomic symbol. Each circle represents an energy level. Dots represent electrons that occupy each energy level. This kind of diagram is called a Bohr-Rutherford diagram.

# Patterns Based on Energy Levels and Electron Arrangements

**The Period-Related Pattern**
An element's period number is the same as the number of energy levels that the electrons of its atoms occupy. For example, Period 1 elements have electrons in one energy level, Period 2 elements have electrons in two energy levels, and so on.

**The Group-Related Pattern**
All the elements in each main group have the same number of electrons in their highest (outer) energy level. The electrons that occupy the outer energy level are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons involved when atoms form compounds and are responsible for the chemical behaviour of elements.
You can infer the number of valence electrons in any main-group element from its group number. For example, Group 1 (IA) elements have one valence electron. Group 2 (IIA) elements have two valence electrons. For elements in Groups 13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA), the number of valence electrons is the same as the second digit in the current numbering system or the only digit in the older numbering system (e.g., Group 15 (VA) has 5 valence electrons).

# Using Lewis Structures to Represent Valence Electrons

Lewis structures are a simpler way to represent elements and the valence electrons of their atoms. To draw a Lewis structure, you replace the nucleus and inner energy levels of an atom with its atomic symbol. Then you place dots around the atomic symbol to represent the valence electrons.

# The Significance of a Full Outer Energy Level

The noble gases in Group 18 (VIIIA) are the only elements that exist as individual atoms in nature. They are extremely unreactive. All the noble gases have outer energy levels that are completely filled with the maximum number of electrons. Helium has a full outer energy level of two valence electrons. The other noble gases have eight valence electrons in the outer energy level. Chemists reason that having a full outer energy level must be a very stable electron arrangement.
When atoms have eight electrons in the outer energy level (or two electrons for hydrogen and helium), chemists say that they have a stable octet. Often this term is shortened to just octet. An octet is a very stable electron arrangement.

# 2.3 Periodic Trends Involving the Sizes and Energy Levels of Atoms

Chemists define, and measure, an atom's size in terms of its radius. The radius of an atom is the distance from its nucleus to the approximate outer boundary of the cloud-like region of its electrons.

# Trends for Atomic Size (Radius)

There are two general trends for atomic size:

- As you go down each group in the periodic table, the size of an atom increases. As you go down a group, the valence electrons occupy an energy level that is farther and farther from the nucleus. Thus, the valence electrons experience less attraction for the nucleus. In addition, electrons in the inner energy levels block, or shield, the valence electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. As a result, the total volume of the atom, and thus the size, increases with each additional energy level.
- As you go across a period, the size of an atom decreases. The positive charge on the nucleus also increases across a period. As well, without additional energy the electrons are restricted to their outer energy level. As a result, the positive force exerted by the nucleus pulls the outer electrons closer, reducing the atom's total size.

# Trends for Ionization Energy

A neutral atom contains equal numbers of positive charges (protons) and negative charges (electrons). The particle that results when a neutral atom gains electrons or gives up electrons is called an ion. Thus, an ion is a charged particle. An atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively charged anion. An atom that gives up electrons becomes a positively charged cation.
The metals that are main-group elements tend to give up electrons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases. Non-metals tend to gain electrons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases.
It takes energy to overcome the attractive force of a nucleus and pull an electron away from a neutral atom. The energy that is required to remove an electron from an atom is called ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove one electron from the outer energy level of the atoms of the main-group elements is called the first ionization energy. It is measured in units of $\mathrm{kJ / mol}$.
All elements, except hydrogen, have more than one electron that can be removed. Therefore, they have more than one ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove a second electron is called the second ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove a third electron is the third ionization energy, and so on.

# Summarizing Trends for Ionization Energy

There are two general trends for ionization energy:

- Ionization energy tends to decrease down a group. Electrons in the outer energy level are farther from the positive force of the nucleus. Thus, they are easier to remove than electrons in lower energy levels.
- Ionization energy tends to increase across a period. As you go across a period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer energy level increases. Thus, more energy is needed to pull an electron away from its atom. A noble gas has the highest ionization energy of all the elements in the same period.

# Manitoba Mine Specializes in Rare Metals

Tantalum is a heavy, hard, and brittle grey metal. In its pure form, it is extremely ductile and can be made into a fine wire. It is resistant to corrosion by most acids, due to its very limited reactivity. At normal temperatures, tantalum is virtually non-reactive. Tantalum has about the same resistance to corrosion as glass, but can withstand higher temperatures. It has a melting point of $3290\mathrm{K}$ — higher than the melting points of all other elements, except tungsten and rhenium. Tantalum's resistance to corrosion and high melting point make it suitable for use in surgical equipment and implants, such as pins for broken bones, and surgical sutures. Tantalum is resistant to corrosion because a thin film of tantalum oxide forms when tantalum is exposed to oxygen, acting as a protective layer. The oxide also has special refractive properties that make it ideal for use in camera lenses.

Cesium is a silvery-white metal. It is found in a mineral called pollucite. Cesium is the softest of all the metals and is a liquid at just above room temperature. It is also the most reactive metal on Earth. Cesium has a low ionization energy. It readily gives up its single valence electron to form crystalline compounds with all the halogen non-metals. Cesium is also very photoelectric, meaning that it easily gives up its lone outer electron when it is exposed to light. Thus, cesium is used in television cameras and traffic signals, and has potential for use in ion propulsion engines for travel into deep space.

# Trends for Electron Affinity

Electron affinity is a measure of the change in energy that occurs when an electron is added to the outer energy level of an atom to form a negative ion. If energy is released when an atom of an element gains an electron, the electron affinity is expressed as a negative integer. When energy is absorbed when an electron is added, electron affinity is low, and is expressed as a positive integer. Fluorine has the highest electron affinity (large, negative integer), indicating it is very likely to be involved in chemical reactions and is the most reactive of all elements. Metals have very low electron affinities, especially Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements, forming stable positive ions.

# Analyzing the Ice Man's Axe

X-ray fluorescence is an analytical technique where an object is irradiated with high-energy X-ray radiation. Its atoms absorb the radiation, causing electrons from a lower energy level to be ejected from the atom. This causes electrons from an outer energy level to "move in," to occupy the vacated space. As the electrons fall to a less energetic state, they emit X-rays. The electrons of each atom emit X-rays of a particular wavelength. Scientists use this energy "signature" to identify the atom.

The trends for electron affinity are:

- Electron affinity tends to decrease down a group.
- Electron affinity tends to increase across a period.

# Section Wrap-up

Despite some irregularities and exceptions, the following periodic trends summarize the relationships among atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity:

- Trends for atomic size are the reverse of trends for ionization energy and electron affinity. Larger atoms tend to have lower ionization energies and lower electron affinities.
- Group 16 (VIA) and 17 (VIIA) elements attract electrons strongly. They do not give up electrons readily. In other words, they have a strong tendency to form negative ions. Thus, they have high ionization energies and high electron affinities.
- Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements give up electrons readily. They have low or no attraction for electrons. In other words, they have a strong tendency to form positive ions. Thus, they have low ionization energies and low electron affinities.
- Group 18 (VIIIA) elements do not attract electrons and do not give up electrons. In other words, they do not naturally form ions. (They are very stable.) Thus, they have very high ionization energies and very low electron affinities.
