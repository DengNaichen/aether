Chemistry is the study of matter and its composition. Chemistry is also the study of what happens when matter interacts with other matter.

Frozen (solid) carbon dioxide is also known as "dry ice." It changes to a gas at temperatures higher than  $-78^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .
Nitrogen gas becomes a liquid at  $-196^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ . Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze delicate materials, such as food, instantly.
Green plants use a chemical process, called photosynthesis, to convert water and carbon dioxide into the food substances they need to survive. All the foods that you eat depend on this process.
Your body uses chemical processes to break down food and to release energy.

Chemists develop models, conduct experiments, and seek patterns. They observe various types of chemical reactions, and they perform calculations based on known data. They build continuously on the work and the discoveries of other scientists.

Long before humans developed a scientific understanding of the world, they invented chemical techniques and processes. These techniques and processes included smelting and shaping metals, growing crops, and making medicines. Early chemists invented technological instruments, such as glassware and distillation equipment.

Present-day chemical technologists continue to invent new equipment. They also invent new or better ways to provide products and services that people want.

The interactions among science, technology, society, and the environment are abbreviated as STSE.

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for life on Earth. Plants need phosphorus, along with other nutrients, in order to grow. Phosphorus is a component of bones and teeth. In addition, phosphorus is excreted as waste from the body. Thus, it is present in human sewage.
Since phosphorus promotes plant growth, phosphates are excellent fertilizers for crops. (Phosphates are chemicals containing phosphorus.) Phosphates are also used as food additives, and as components in some medicines. In addition, they are an important part of dishwasher and laundry detergents. For example, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) acts to soften water, and keep dirt suspended in the water. Before the 1970s, STPP was a major ingredient in most detergents.

Eutrophication is the process in which excess nutrients in a lake or river cause algae to grow rapidly.

John Charles Polanyi pioneered the field of reaction dynamics, which addresses one of the most basic questions in chemistry: What happens when two substances interact to produce another substance? Dr. Polanyi tried to provide some answers by studying the very faint light that is given off by molecules as they undergo chemical changes. This light is invisible to the unaided eye, because it is emitted in the infrared range of energy. It can be detected, however, with the right instruments. Dr. Polanyi's work led to the invention of the laser. As well, his research helped to explain what happens to energy during a chemical reaction.

Matter is anything that has mass and volume (takes up space).

Characteristics that help you describe and identify matter are called properties. Examples of properties include physical state, colour, odour, texture, boiling temperature, density, and flammability (combustibility).

Table 1.2 Common Properties of Matter
| Physical Properties | Chemical Properties |
|---|---|
| **Qualitative** | **Quantitative** | |
| physical state | melting point | reactivity with water |
| colour | boiling point | reactivity with air |
| odour | density | reactivity with pure oxygen |
| crystal shape | solubility | reactivity with acids |
| malleability | electrical conductivity | reactivity with pure substances |
| ductility | thermal conductivity | combustibility (flammability) |
| hardness | | toxicity |
| brittleness | | decomposition |

A physical property is a property that you can observe without changing one kind of matter into something new. For example, iron is a strong metal with a shiny surface. It is solid at room temperature, but it can be heated and formed into different shapes. These properties can all be observed without changing iron into something new.

A chemical property is a property that you can observe when one kind of matter is converted into a different kind of matter. For example, a chemical property of iron is that it reacts with oxygen to form a different kind of matter: rust. Rust and iron have completely different physical and chemical properties.
Glucose test paper changes colour in the presence of glucose. Thus, a chemical property of glucose test paper is that it changes colour in response to glucose. Similarly, a chemical property of glucose is that it changes the colour of glucose test paper.

Some properties of matter, such as colour, and flammability, are qualitative. You can describe them in words, but you cannot measure them or express them numerically. Other properties, such as density and boiling point, can be measured and expressed numerically. Such properties are quantitative.

Scientists rely on a standard system of measurement. This system is called the International System of Units (Le système international d'unités, SI). It allows scientists anywhere in the world to describe matter in the same quantitative language. There are seven base SI units, and many more units that are derived from them. The metre (m), the kilogram (kg), and the second (s) are three of the base SI units. The mole (mol) and the kelvin (K) are two more base units.

Table 1.3 Important SI Quantities and Their Units
| Quantity | Definition | SI units or their derived equivalents | Equipment use to measure the quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| mass | the amount of matter in an object | kilogram (kg) gram (g) milligram (mg) | balance |
| length | the distance between two points | metre (m) centimetre (cm) millimetre (mm) | ruler |
| temperature | the hotness or coldness of a substance | kelvin (K) degrees Celsius (°C) | thermometer |
| volume | the amount of space that an object occupies | cubic metre (m³) cubic centimetre (cm³) litre (L) millilitre (mL) | beaker, graduated cylinder, or pipette; may also be calculated |
| mole | the amount of a substance | mole (mol) | calculated not measured |
| density | the mass per unit of volume of a substance | kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³) grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm³) | calculated or measured |
| energy | the capacity to do work (to move matter) | joule (J) | calculated not measured |

Numbers that you can count or numbers that are true by definition are called exact numbers.

All measurements involve uncertainty. One source of this uncertainty is the measuring device itself. Another source is your ability to perceive and interpret a reading. In fact, you cannot measure anything with complete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement is always an estimate.

The digits that you record when you measure something are called significant digits. Significant digits include the digits that you are certain about and a final, uncertain digit that you estimate. For example,  $4.28\mathrm{g}$  has three significant digits. The first two digits, the 4 and the 2, are certain. The last digit, the 8, is an estimate. Therefore, it is uncertain. The value 4.3 has two significant digits. The 4 is certain, and the 3 is uncertain.

Table 1.4 Rules for Determining Significant Digits
| Rules | Examples |
|---|---|
| 1. All non-zero numbers are significant. | 7.886 has four significant digits. 19.4 has three significant digits. 527.266 992 has nine significant digits. |
| 2. All zeros that are located between two non-zero numbers are significant. | 408 has three significant digits. 25 074 has five significant digits. |
| 3. Zeros that are located to the left of a value are not significant. | 0.0907 has three significant digits. They are the 9, the third 0 to the right, and the 7. The function of the 0.0 at the beginning is only to locate the decimal. 0.000 000 000 06 has one significant digit. |
| 4. Zeros that are located to the right of a value may or may not be significant. | 22 700 may have three significant digits, or it may have five significant digits. |

The Great Lakes contain  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$  of water. This is an approximate value. The actual volume could be anywhere from  $22651\mathrm{km}^3$  to  $22749\mathrm{km}^3$ . You can use scientific notation to rewrite  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$  as  $2.27 \times 10^4\mathrm{km}$ . This shows that only three digits are significant.
If you were able to measure the volume of water in the Great Lakes and verify the value of  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$ , then all five digits (including the zeros) would be significant. Scientific notation lets you show clearly the five significant digits:  $2.2700 \times 10^{4}\mathrm{km}^{3}$ .

Accuracy refers to how close a given quantity is to an accepted or expected value. Precision may refer to the exactness of a measurement. Precision may also refer to the closeness of a series of data points. Data that are very close to one another are said to be precise. A set of data can be precise but not accurate.

Table 1.5 Rules for Reporting Significant Digits in Calculations
| Rule 1: Multiplying and Dividing | The value with the fewest number of significant digits, going into the calculation, determines the number of significant digits that you should report in your answer. |
|---|---|
| Rule 2: Adding and Subtracting | The value with the fewest number of decimal places, going into the calculation, determines the number of decimal places that you should report in your answer. |
| Rule 3: Rounding | To get the appropriate number of significant digits (rule 1) or decimal places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer. If your answer ends in a number that is greater than 5, increase the preceding digit by 1. For example, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35. If your answer ends with a number that is less than 5, leave the preceding number unchanged. For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7. If your answer ends with 5, increase the preceding number by 1 if it is odd. Leave the preceding number unchanged if it is even. For example, 18.35 can be rounded to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded to 18.2. |

A change of state alters the appearance of matter. The composition of matter remains the same, however, regardless of its state. For example, ice, liquid water, and water vapour are all the same kind of matter: water. Changes that affect the physical appearance of matter, but not its composition, are physical changes.

Electrical energy passed through water causes it to decompose into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. These gases have physical and chemical properties that are different from the properties of water and from each other's properties. Therefore, decomposing water is a change that affects the composition of water. Changes that alter the composition of matter are called chemical changes. Iron rusting, wood burning, and bread baking are three examples of chemical changes.

A physical change results in a change of physical properties only. A chemical change results in a change of both physical and chemical properties.

All matter can be classified into two groups: mixtures and pure substances. A mixture is a physical combination of two or more kinds of matter. The components in a mixture can occur in different proportions (relative quantities). Each individual component retains its identity.

Mixtures in which the different components are clearly visible are called heterogeneous mixtures. The prefix "hetero-" comes from the Greek word heteros, meaning "different."
Mixtures in which the components are blended together so well that the mixture looks like just one substance are called homogeneous mixtures. The prefix "homo- " comes from the Greek word homos, meaning "the same." Homogeneous mixtures are also called solutions.

A pure substance has a definite composition, which stays the same in response to physical changes. A lump of copper is a pure substance. Water (with nothing dissolved in it) is also a pure substance. Diamond, carbon dioxide, gold, oxygen, and aluminum are pure substances, too.

Pure substances are further classified into elements and compounds. An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated chemically into any simpler substances. Copper, zinc, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon are examples of elements.

A compound is a pure substance that results when two or more elements combine chemically to form a different substance. Compounds can be broken down into elements using chemical processes. For example, carbon dioxide is a compound. It can be separated into the elements carbon and oxygen.

**Matter**
anything that has mass and volume
found in three physical states: solid, liquid, gas

**Mixtures**
physical combinations of matter in which each component retains its identity
- **Heterogeneous Mixtures (Mechanical Mixtures)**: all components are visible
- **Homogeneous Mixtures (Solutions)**: components are blended so that it looks like a single substance.

**Pure Substances**
matter that has a definite composition
- **Elements**: matter that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances
- **Compounds**: matter in which two or more elements are chemically combined

The classification system for matter is based mainly on the changes that matter undergoes:
- physical changes to separate mixtures into elements or compounds
- chemical changes to convert compounds or elements into different compounds or elements
