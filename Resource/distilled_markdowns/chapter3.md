# Classifying Chemical Compounds

Gold, silver, and platinum are three metals that can be found in Earth's crust as elements. Most other metals, and most other elements, are found in nature only as compounds.

Water, $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$, is a compound. Starch is a complex compound that consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is commonly called table salt. Pyrite (iron disulfide, $\mathrm{FeS}_2$) is a compound.

There are only about 90 naturally occurring elements. There are thousands upon thousands of different compounds in nature. Elements combine in many different ways to form the astonishing variety of natural and synthetic compounds.

Chemists have developed a classification system to organize compounds according to their properties, such as melting point, boiling point, hardness, conductivity, and solubility.

Humans have invented ways to extract iron from its compounds in order to take advantage of its properties. Iron forms rust, or iron(III) oxide, $\mathsf{Fe}_2\mathsf{O}_3$.

Based on their physical properties, compounds can be classified into two groups: ionic compounds and covalent compounds. Some of the properties of ionic and covalent compounds are summarized in Table 3.1.

| Property                                  | Ionic compound      | Covalent compound     |

Sodium chloride, NaCl, is a familiar compound, known as table salt. The sodium in sodium chloride plays a vital role in body functions. We need to ingest about $500\mathrm{mg}$ of sodium a day. Too much sodium chloride may contribute to high blood pressure. Sodium chloride is put on roads and sidewalks to melt the ice because salt water has a lower melting point than pure water.

Sodium chloride is a typical ionic compound. Like most ionic compounds, it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It melts at a very high temperature, at $801^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. As well, it dissolves easily in water. A solution of sodium chloride in water is a good conductor of electricity. Liquid sodium chloride is also a good electrical conductor.

The cells of most organisms produce carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, during cellular respiration: the process that releases energy from food. Plants synthesize their own food from carbon dioxide and water using the Sun's energy.

Carbon dioxide has most of the properties of a typical covalent compound. It has a low melting point $(-79^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$. At certain pressures and temperatures, carbon dioxide is a liquid. Liquid carbon dioxide is a weak conductor of electricity. Carbon dioxide is somewhat soluble in water, especially at high pressures. A solution of carbon dioxide in water is a weak conductor of electricity.

Chemical bonds are the forces that attract atoms to each other in compounds. Bonding involves the interaction between the valence electrons of atoms. Usually the formation of a bond between two atoms creates a compound that is more stable than either of the two atoms on their own.

The different properties of ionic and covalent compounds result from the manner in which chemical bonds form between atoms in these compounds. Atoms can either exchange or share electrons.

When two atoms exchange electrons, one atom loses its valence electron(s) and the other atom gains the electron(s). This kind of bonding usually occurs between a metal and a non-metal. Metals have low ionization energies and non-metals have high electron affinities. That is, metals tend to lose electrons and non-metals tend to gain them. When atoms exchange electrons, they form an ionic bond.

Atoms can also share electrons. This kind of bond forms between two non-metals. It can also form between a metal and a non-metal when the metal has a fairly high ionization energy. When atoms share electrons, they form a covalent bond.

Examining the physical properties of a compound is one method to determine bond type, but it is not always satisfactory. Often a compound has some ionic characteristics and some covalent characteristics. For example, hydrogen chloride, also known as hydrochloric acid, has a low melting point and a low boiling point (it is a gas at room temperature), suggesting it is covalent. However, it is extremely soluble in water, and the water solution conducts electricity, which are characteristics of an ionic compound.

The electronegativity of an atom is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. EN is used to symbolize electronegativity. There is a specific electronegativity associated with each element.

Electronegativity is a periodic property. It increases up a group and across a period. The trend for electronegativity is the reverse of the trend for atomic size. In general, as atomic size decreases from left to right across a period, electronegativity increases. This is because the number of protons (which attract electrons) in the nucleus increases, while the number of filled, inner electron energy levels (which shield the protons from valence electrons) remains the same. Thus the electrons are pulled more tightly to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atomic size. The atom attracts a bonding pair of electrons more strongly, because the bonding pair can move closer to the nucleus.

In the second period, lithium has the largest atomic size and the lowest electronegativity. As atomic size decreases across the second period, the electronegativity increases. Fluorine has the smallest atomic size in the third period (except for neon) and the highest electronegativity. Because noble gases do not usually participate in bonding, their electronegativities are not given.

Similarly, as atomic size increases down a group, electronegativity decreases. As you move down a group, valence electrons are less strongly attracted to the nucleus because the number of filled electron energy levels between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. In a compound, increasing energy levels between valence electrons and the nucleus mean that the nucleus attracts bonding pairs less strongly.

For example, in Group 2 (IIA), beryllium has the smallest atomic radius and the largest electronegativity. As atomic size increases down the group, electronegativity decreases.

The relationship between atomic size and electronegativity for the main-group elements in periods 2 to 6 shows they are inversely related.

You can use the differences between electronegativities to decide whether the bond between two atoms is ionic or covalent. The symbol $\Delta EN$ stands for the difference between two electronegativity values. When calculating the electronegativity difference, the smaller electronegativity is always subtracted from the larger electronegativity, so that the electronegativity difference is always positive.

When two atoms have electronegativities that are identical, as in oxygen, they share their bonding pair of electrons equally between them in a covalent bond. When two atoms have electronegativities that are very different, as in potassium fluoride, the atom with the lower electronegativity loses an electron to the atom with the higher electronegativity. In potassium fluoride, potassium gives up its valence electron to fluorine. Therefore, the bond is ionic.

Atoms with different electronegativities can share electrons unequally without exchanging them.

Figure 3.8 shows the range of electronegativity differences. These values go from mostly covalent at 0.0 to mostly ionic at 3.3. Chemists consider bonds with an electronegativity difference that is greater than 1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity difference that is less than 1.7 to be covalent.

Table 3.2 shows how you can think of bonds as having a percent ionic character or percent covalent character, based on their electronegativity differences. When bonds have nearly $50\%$ ionic or covalent character, they have characteristics of both types of bonding.

Table 3.2 Character of Bonds

| Electronegativity difference | 0.00 | 0.65 | 0.94 | 1.19 | 1.43 | 1.67 | 1.91 | 2.19 | 2.54 | 3.03 |
| :--------------------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Percent ionic character      | 0%   | 10%  | 20%  | 30%  | 40%  | 50%  | 60%  | 70%  | 80%  | 90%  |
| Percent covalent character   | 100% | 90%  | 80%  | 70%  | 60%  | 50%  | 40%  | 30%  | 20%  | 10%  |

For the bond in hydrogen chloride, HCl, $\Delta EN$ is 0.96. This is lower than 1.7. Therefore, the bond in hydrogen chloride is a covalent bond.

# Ionic and Covalent Bonding: The Octet Rule

When atoms are bonded together, they are often more stable. Noble gases are the most stable elements in the periodic table because they are extremely unreactive and do not tend to form compounds. They have a filled outer electron energy level. When an atom loses, gains, or shares electrons through bonding to achieve a filled outer electron energy level, the resulting compound is often very stable.

According to the octet rule, atoms bond in order to achieve an electron configuration that is the same as the electron configuration of a noble gas. When two atoms or ions have the same electron configuration, they are said to be isoelectronic with one another. For example, $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is isoelectronic with Ar because both have 18 electrons and a filled outer energy level. This rule is called the octet rule because all the noble gases (except helium) have eight electrons in their filled outer energy level. (Helium's outer electron energy level contains only two electrons.)

The electronegativity difference for the bond between sodium and chlorine is 2.1, indicating an ionic bond. Sodium has a very low electronegativity, and chlorine has a very high electronegativity. Therefore, when sodium and chlorine interact, sodium transfers its valence electron to chlorine. Sodium becomes $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and chlorine becomes $\mathrm{Cl^-}$.

The formation of an ionic bond between sodium and chlorine reflects the octet rule. Neutral sodium has one valence electron. When it loses this electron to chlorine, the resulting $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ cation has an electron energy level that contains eight electrons, making it isoelectronic with the noble gas neon. Chlorine has an outer electron energy level that contains seven electrons. When chlorine gains sodium's electron, it becomes an anion that is isoelectronic with the noble gas argon. The formation of an ionic bond can be represented using Lewis structures.

In an ionic bond, electrons are transferred from one atom to another so that they form oppositely charged ions. The strong force of attraction between the oppositely charged ions is what holds them together.

In sodium chloride, NaCl, one electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine. In order to satisfy the octet rule, two or three electrons may be transferred from one atom to another. For example, when magnesium and oxygen combine, the electronegativity difference for magnesium oxide is $3.4 - 1.3 = 2.1$, so it is an ionic compound. Magnesium contains two electrons in its outer shell. Oxygen contains six electrons in its outer shell. To become isoelectronic with a noble gas, magnesium needs to lose two electrons and oxygen needs to gain two electrons. Hence, magnesium transfers its two valence electrons to oxygen. Magnesium becomes $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and oxygen becomes $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$.

Sometimes ionic compounds contain more than one atom of each element. For example, in the compound formed from calcium and fluorine, the electronegativity difference is 3.0, indicating an ionic bond. Calcium has two electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs to lose two electrons according to the octet rule. Fluorine has seven electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs to gain one electron. Therefore, one calcium atom bonds with two fluorine atoms. Calcium loses one of each of its valence electrons to each fluorine atom. Calcium becomes $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, and fluorine becomes $\mathrm{F^{-}}$. They form the compound calcium fluoride, $\mathrm{CaF_2}$.

Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in their solid state. They are very good conductors in their liquid state or when they are dissolved in water. An electrical current can flow only if charged particles are available to move and carry the current. In the solid state, sodium and chlorine ions are bonded to each other by strong ionic bonds and are arranged in a rigid lattice formation. The ions cannot move very much, so there is no mobile charge. Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.

In molten sodium chloride, the rigid lattice structure is broken. The ions that make up the compound are free to move, and they easily conduct electricity. Similarly, when sodium chloride is dissolved, the sodium and chlorine ions are free to move. The solution is a good conductor of electricity.

When a clear solution of an ionic compound is poured over a seed crystal of the same compound, the ions align themselves according to the geometric arrangement in the seed crystal.

When the electronegativity difference between two atoms is very small or zero, they form covalent bonds. For example, each chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer energy level and needs to gain one electron to achieve a stable octet. When two chlorine atoms bond together, their electronegativity difference is zero, so the electrons are equally attracted to each atom. Instead of transferring electrons, the two atoms each share one electron with each other. A covalent bond consists of a pair of shared electrons. Thus, each chlorine atom achieves a filled outer electron energy level, satisfying the octet rule.

When two atoms of the same element form a bond, they share their electrons equally in a pure covalent bond. Elements with atoms that bond to each other in this way are known as diatomic elements. Some examples of diatomic elements are chlorine, $\mathsf{Cl}_2$, bromine, $\mathsf{Br}_2$, iodine, $\mathsf{I}_2$, nitrogen, $\mathsf{N}_2$, and hydrogen, $\mathsf{H}_2$.

When atoms such as carbon and hydrogen bond to each other, their electronegativities are so close that they share their electrons almost equally. Carbon and hydrogen have an electronegativity difference of only $2.6 - 2.2 = 0.4$. One atom of carbon forms a covalent bond with four atoms of hydrogen, forming methane, $\mathrm{CH}_4$. Each hydrogen atom shares one of its electrons with the carbon. The carbon shares one of its four valence electrons with each hydrogen. Thus, each hydrogen atom achieves a filled outer energy level, and so does carbon. When analyzing Lewis structures that show covalent bonds, count the shared electrons as if they belong to each of the bonding atoms.

In covalent bonding, atoms sometimes need to share two or three pairs of electrons, according to the octet rule. For example, in diatomic oxygen, each oxygen atom has six electrons in its outer energy level and requires two additional electrons to achieve a stable octet. When two oxygen atoms form a bond, they share two pairs of electrons. This kind of covalent bond is called a double bond.

Double bonds can form between different elements. For example, in carbon dioxide, carbon bonds to oxygen. To achieve a stable octet, carbon requires four electrons, and oxygen requires two electrons. Hence, two atoms of oxygen bond to one atom of carbon. Each oxygen forms a double bond with the carbon.

When atoms share three pairs of electrons, they form a triple bond. Diatomic nitrogen contains a triple bond.

Covalent compounds have a wider variety of properties than ionic compounds. Pure covalent compounds with bonds having an electronegativity difference less than 0.5, such as carbon disulfide, $\mathrm{CS}_2$, dichlorine monoxide, $\mathrm{Cl}_2\mathrm{O}$, and carbon tetrachloride, $\mathrm{CCl}_4$, generally have low boiling points and do not conduct electricity in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state.

The atoms in pure covalent compounds are held together by strong covalent bonds. These bonds do not break when the compound melts or boils. Covalent compounds do not break up into ions when they melt or boil. Instead, their atoms remain bonded together as molecules. For this reason, covalent compounds are also called molecular compounds. The molecules that make up a pure covalent compound cannot carry a current, even if the compound is in its liquid state or in solution.

Covalent compounds form liquids and solids at low temperatures, meaning something must hold the molecules together. The forces that bond the atoms to each other within a molecule are called intramolecular forces. Covalent bonds are intramolecular forces. In comparison, the forces that bond molecules to each other are called intermolecular forces. Because pure covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points, the intermolecular forces must be very weak compared with the intramolecular forces.

In metallic bonding, atoms release their electrons to a shared pool of electrons. A metal can be thought of as a non-rigid arrangement of metal ions in a sea of free electrons. The force that holds metal atoms together is called a metallic bond. Unlike ionic or covalent bonding, metallic bonding does not have a particular orientation in space. Because the electrons are free to move, the metal ions are not rigidly held in a lattice formation. Therefore, when a hammer pounds metal, the atoms can slide past one another, explaining why metals can be easily hammered into sheets.

Pure metals contain metallic bonds, as do alloys. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals. Each alloy has a uniform composition throughout. Bronze, an alloy, contains copper, tin, and lead, joined together with metallic bonds.

# 3.3

# Polar Covalent Bonds and Polar Molecules

When two bonding atoms have an electronegativity difference that is greater than 0.5 but less than 1.7, they are considered to form a polar covalent bond. In a polar covalent bond, the atoms have significantly different electronegativities. The electronegativity difference is not great enough for the less electronegative atom to transfer its valence electrons to the other, more electronegative atom. The difference is great enough for the bonding electron pair to spend more time near the more electronegative atom than the less electronegative atom.

For example, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water has an electronegativity difference of 1.24, making it a polar covalent bond. The oxygen attracts the electrons more strongly than the hydrogen. Therefore, the oxygen has a slightly negative charge and the hydrogen has a slightly positive charge. Since the hydrogen does not completely transfer its electron to the oxygen, their respective charges are not $+1$ and $-1$, but rather $\delta^{+}$ and $\delta^{-}$. The symbol $\delta^{+}$ (delta plus) stands for a partial positive charge. The symbol $\delta^{-}$ (delta minus) stands for a partial negative charge.

Different types of diagrams, or models, are useful for highlighting various aspects of molecules and bonding:
*   A Lewis structure shows exactly how many electrons are involved in each bond in a compound, including non-bonding pairs.
*   A structural diagram shows single bonds as single lines and multiple bonds as multiple lines, without non-bonding pairs.
*   A ball-and-stick model shows atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks, accurately showing bond orientation in three-dimensional space, though distances are exaggerated.
*   A space-filling model shows atoms as spheres and is the most accurate representation of the shape of a real molecule.

Molecules have different shapes. For example, water and carbon dioxide molecules have different shapes.

To understand why molecules have different shapes, consider how electron arrangement affects shape. The Lewis structure for water shows that the oxygen is surrounded by four electron pairs: two bonding pairs with hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs (not involved in bonding). Electron pairs are arranged around molecules so that they are a maximum distance from each other due to repulsion. The shape that allows four electron pairs to be a maximum distance from each other around an atom is a tetrahedron.

In a water molecule, the four electron pairs around the oxygen atom are arranged in a nearly tetrahedral shape. When only the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms are considered, the molecule has a bent shape due to the two lone pairs.

A carbon dioxide molecule has a linear shape. The central carbon atom is surrounded by eight electrons (four pairs), all involved in bonding (no lone pairs). The bonding electrons spend most of their time between the carbon and oxygen atoms, arranged in a straight line, allowing them to be as far away from each other as possible.

The shapes of the water molecule and the carbon dioxide molecule are supported by experiment.

The ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_3$, molecule has three bonding electron pairs and one lone pair on its central atom, all arranged in a nearly tetrahedral shape. Because there is one lone pair, the molecule's shape is pyramidal. The methane, $\mathrm{CH}_4$, molecule has four bonding pairs on its central atom and no lone pairs. It is shaped like a perfectly symmetrical tetrahedron.

Water molecules are attracted to one another. This attraction is evident in phenomena like water spray forming a "sheet," water bulging over a glass rim, and beads of water on surfaces.

A water molecule has a bent shape. Each oxygen-hydrogen bond is polar, with the hydrogen atom having a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom having a partial negative charge. Because the molecule is bent, there is a partial negative charge on the oxygen end and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen end.

Because the water molecule as a whole has a partial negative charge on one end and a partial positive charge on the other end, it is called a polar molecule. Because water is polar, its negative and positive ends attract each other, explaining why liquid water "sticks" to itself.

Two other examples of polar molecules are ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Polar molecules are also called dipolar molecules because they have a negative pole and a positive pole.

The bond between carbon and oxygen is polar, with an electronegativity difference of 1.0. However, carbon dioxide, a molecule that contains two carbon-oxygen double bonds, is a non-polar molecule. The oxygen atoms have partial negative charges, and the carbon atom has a partial positive charge. The molecule is straight and symmetrical, so the effects of the polar bonds cancel each other out. Therefore, while carbon dioxide contains polar bonds, it is a non-polar molecule. It has neither a positive pole nor a negative pole.

Carbon tetrafluoride, $\mathrm{CF_4}$, is another example of a non-polar molecule that contains polar bonds due to its symmetry.

Because water is made up of polar molecules with positive and negative ends that attract one another, water tends to "stick" to itself. This means that it has a high melting point and boiling point, relative to other covalent compounds. Carbon dioxide is made up of non-polar molecules. These molecules do not attract each other as much as polar molecules do, because they do not have positive and negative poles. Compounds that are made up of non-polar molecules generally have lower melting points and boiling points than compounds that are made up of polar molecules. Compounds with non-polar molecules, like carbon dioxide, are often gases at room temperature.

Differences in melting points and boiling points are due in part to the polarity of the molecules that make up the compounds. They are also due to the different masses of the individual molecules.

# Writing Chemical Formulas and Naming Chemical Compounds

Lewis structures are helpful for keeping track of electron transfers in bonding and for making sure that the octet rule is obeyed. Lewis structures can be used to help determine the ratio of the atoms in a compound.

A chemical formula provides two important pieces of information:
1. the elements that make up the compound
2. the number of atoms of each element that are present in a compound

The order in which the elements are written also communicates important information. The less electronegative element or ion is usually listed first in the formula, and the more electronegative element or ion comes second. For example, the ionic compound formed from calcium and bromine is written $\mathrm{CaBr}_2$. Calcium, a metal with low electronegativity, is written first. The subscript 2 after the bromine indicates that there are two bromine atoms for every calcium atom. When a subscript is omitted, only one atom is present per formula unit.

For covalent compounds, the chemical formula represents how many of each type of atom are in each molecule. For example, the formula $\mathrm{NH}_3$ signifies that a molecule of ammonia contains one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. The formula $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6$ tells you that a molecule of propane contains two atoms of carbon and six atoms of hydrogen.

For ionic compounds, the formula represents a ratio rather than a discrete particle. For example, the formula for magnesium oxide, MgO, signifies that magnesium and oxygen exist in a one-to-one atomic ratio. MgO exists in a lattice structure held together by ionic bonds. The formula MgO represents the ratio in which ions are present in the compound.

Every element has a certain capacity to combine with other atoms. A number is assigned to each element to describe the element's bonding capacity, called the valence. An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element has the capacity to lose one electron from its valence level. Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements, such as sodium and lithium, have a valence of $+1$. The 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. The + indicates that these elements tend to give up their electrons, becoming positively charged ions. They may transfer their electrons, or they may attract the electron relatively weakly in a polar covalent bond.

Group 17 (VIIA) elements (the halogens) have a valence of $-1$. The 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. They need to gain an electron to achieve a stable octet. In general, halogens become more negatively charged when they participate in bonding.

As a general rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence tells you the charges on the ions that are formed. If a covalent bond is formed, the valence tells you how many electrons the atoms contribute to the covalent bond.

You can use the periodic table to predict valence numbers. For example, Group 2 (IIA) elements have two electrons in their outer energy level. To achieve a stable octet, they need to lose these two electrons. Therefore, the valence for all Group 2 elements is $+2$.

The smaller atoms of elements in the first two periods usually have only one common valence, which is easily determined from the periodic table. Many larger elements, however, have more than one valence because the electron distribution in these elements is much more complex. Some useful valences are listed in Table 3.3, with the most common valences listed first.
