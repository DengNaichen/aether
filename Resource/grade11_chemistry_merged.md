Chemistry is the study of matter and its composition. Chemistry is also the study of what happens when matter interacts with other matter.

Frozen (solid) carbon dioxide is also known as "dry ice." It changes to a gas at temperatures higher than  $-78^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .
Nitrogen gas becomes a liquid at  $-196^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ . Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze delicate materials, such as food, instantly.
Green plants use a chemical process, called photosynthesis, to convert water and carbon dioxide into the food substances they need to survive. All the foods that you eat depend on this process.
Your body uses chemical processes to break down food and to release energy.

Chemists develop models, conduct experiments, and seek patterns. They observe various types of chemical reactions, and they perform calculations based on known data. They build continuously on the work and the discoveries of other scientists.

Long before humans developed a scientific understanding of the world, they invented chemical techniques and processes. These techniques and processes included smelting and shaping metals, growing crops, and making medicines. Early chemists invented technological instruments, such as glassware and distillation equipment.

Present-day chemical technologists continue to invent new equipment. They also invent new or better ways to provide products and services that people want.

The interactions among science, technology, society, and the environment are abbreviated as STSE.

Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for life on Earth. Plants need phosphorus, along with other nutrients, in order to grow. Phosphorus is a component of bones and teeth. In addition, phosphorus is excreted as waste from the body. Thus, it is present in human sewage.
Since phosphorus promotes plant growth, phosphates are excellent fertilizers for crops. (Phosphates are chemicals containing phosphorus.) Phosphates are also used as food additives, and as components in some medicines. In addition, they are an important part of dishwasher and laundry detergents. For example, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) acts to soften water, and keep dirt suspended in the water. Before the 1970s, STPP was a major ingredient in most detergents.

Eutrophication is the process in which excess nutrients in a lake or river cause algae to grow rapidly.

John Charles Polanyi pioneered the field of reaction dynamics, which addresses one of the most basic questions in chemistry: What happens when two substances interact to produce another substance? Dr. Polanyi tried to provide some answers by studying the very faint light that is given off by molecules as they undergo chemical changes. This light is invisible to the unaided eye, because it is emitted in the infrared range of energy. It can be detected, however, with the right instruments. Dr. Polanyi's work led to the invention of the laser. As well, his research helped to explain what happens to energy during a chemical reaction.

Matter is anything that has mass and volume (takes up space).

Characteristics that help you describe and identify matter are called properties. Examples of properties include physical state, colour, odour, texture, boiling temperature, density, and flammability (combustibility).

Table 1.2 Common Properties of Matter
| Physical Properties | Chemical Properties |
|---|---|
| **Qualitative** | **Quantitative** | |
| physical state | melting point | reactivity with water |
| colour | boiling point | reactivity with air |
| odour | density | reactivity with pure oxygen |
| crystal shape | solubility | reactivity with acids |
| malleability | electrical conductivity | reactivity with pure substances |
| ductility | thermal conductivity | combustibility (flammability) |
| hardness | | toxicity |
| brittleness | | decomposition |

A physical property is a property that you can observe without changing one kind of matter into something new. For example, iron is a strong metal with a shiny surface. It is solid at room temperature, but it can be heated and formed into different shapes. These properties can all be observed without changing iron into something new.

A chemical property is a property that you can observe when one kind of matter is converted into a different kind of matter. For example, a chemical property of iron is that it reacts with oxygen to form a different kind of matter: rust. Rust and iron have completely different physical and chemical properties.
Glucose test paper changes colour in the presence of glucose. Thus, a chemical property of glucose test paper is that it changes colour in response to glucose. Similarly, a chemical property of glucose is that it changes the colour of glucose test paper.

Some properties of matter, such as colour, and flammability, are qualitative. You can describe them in words, but you cannot measure them or express them numerically. Other properties, such as density and boiling point, can be measured and expressed numerically. Such properties are quantitative.

Scientists rely on a standard system of measurement. This system is called the International System of Units (Le système international d'unités, SI). It allows scientists anywhere in the world to describe matter in the same quantitative language. There are seven base SI units, and many more units that are derived from them. The metre (m), the kilogram (kg), and the second (s) are three of the base SI units. The mole (mol) and the kelvin (K) are two more base units.

Table 1.3 Important SI Quantities and Their Units
| Quantity | Definition | SI units or their derived equivalents | Equipment use to measure the quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| mass | the amount of matter in an object | kilogram (kg) gram (g) milligram (mg) | balance |
| length | the distance between two points | metre (m) centimetre (cm) millimetre (mm) | ruler |
| temperature | the hotness or coldness of a substance | kelvin (K) degrees Celsius (°C) | thermometer |
| volume | the amount of space that an object occupies | cubic metre (m³) cubic centimetre (cm³) litre (L) millilitre (mL) | beaker, graduated cylinder, or pipette; may also be calculated |
| mole | the amount of a substance | mole (mol) | calculated not measured |
| density | the mass per unit of volume of a substance | kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m³) grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm³) | calculated or measured |
| energy | the capacity to do work (to move matter) | joule (J) | calculated not measured |

Numbers that you can count or numbers that are true by definition are called exact numbers.

All measurements involve uncertainty. One source of this uncertainty is the measuring device itself. Another source is your ability to perceive and interpret a reading. In fact, you cannot measure anything with complete certainty. The last (farthest right) digit in any measurement is always an estimate.

The digits that you record when you measure something are called significant digits. Significant digits include the digits that you are certain about and a final, uncertain digit that you estimate. For example,  $4.28\mathrm{g}$  has three significant digits. The first two digits, the 4 and the 2, are certain. The last digit, the 8, is an estimate. Therefore, it is uncertain. The value 4.3 has two significant digits. The 4 is certain, and the 3 is uncertain.

Table 1.4 Rules for Determining Significant Digits
| Rules | Examples |
|---|---|
| 1. All non-zero numbers are significant. | 7.886 has four significant digits. 19.4 has three significant digits. 527.266 992 has nine significant digits. |
| 2. All zeros that are located between two non-zero numbers are significant. | 408 has three significant digits. 25 074 has five significant digits. |
| 3. Zeros that are located to the left of a value are not significant. | 0.0907 has three significant digits. They are the 9, the third 0 to the right, and the 7. The function of the 0.0 at the beginning is only to locate the decimal. 0.000 000 000 06 has one significant digit. |
| 4. Zeros that are located to the right of a value may or may not be significant. | 22 700 may have three significant digits, or it may have five significant digits. |

The Great Lakes contain  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$  of water. This is an approximate value. The actual volume could be anywhere from  $22651\mathrm{km}^3$  to  $22749\mathrm{km}^3$ . You can use scientific notation to rewrite  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$  as  $2.27 \times 10^4\mathrm{km}$ . This shows that only three digits are significant.
If you were able to measure the volume of water in the Great Lakes and verify the value of  $22700\mathrm{km}^3$ , then all five digits (including the zeros) would be significant. Scientific notation lets you show clearly the five significant digits:  $2.2700 \times 10^{4}\mathrm{km}^{3}$ .

Accuracy refers to how close a given quantity is to an accepted or expected value. Precision may refer to the exactness of a measurement. Precision may also refer to the closeness of a series of data points. Data that are very close to one another are said to be precise. A set of data can be precise but not accurate.

Table 1.5 Rules for Reporting Significant Digits in Calculations
| Rule 1: Multiplying and Dividing | The value with the fewest number of significant digits, going into the calculation, determines the number of significant digits that you should report in your answer. |
|---|---|
| Rule 2: Adding and Subtracting | The value with the fewest number of decimal places, going into the calculation, determines the number of decimal places that you should report in your answer. |
| Rule 3: Rounding | To get the appropriate number of significant digits (rule 1) or decimal places (rule 2), you may need to round your answer. If your answer ends in a number that is greater than 5, increase the preceding digit by 1. For example, 2.346 can be rounded to 2.35. If your answer ends with a number that is less than 5, leave the preceding number unchanged. For example, 5.73 can be rounded to 5.7. If your answer ends with 5, increase the preceding number by 1 if it is odd. Leave the preceding number unchanged if it is even. For example, 18.35 can be rounded to 18.4, but 18.25 is rounded to 18.2. |

A change of state alters the appearance of matter. The composition of matter remains the same, however, regardless of its state. For example, ice, liquid water, and water vapour are all the same kind of matter: water. Changes that affect the physical appearance of matter, but not its composition, are physical changes.

Electrical energy passed through water causes it to decompose into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. These gases have physical and chemical properties that are different from the properties of water and from each other's properties. Therefore, decomposing water is a change that affects the composition of water. Changes that alter the composition of matter are called chemical changes. Iron rusting, wood burning, and bread baking are three examples of chemical changes.

A physical change results in a change of physical properties only. A chemical change results in a change of both physical and chemical properties.

All matter can be classified into two groups: mixtures and pure substances. A mixture is a physical combination of two or more kinds of matter. The components in a mixture can occur in different proportions (relative quantities). Each individual component retains its identity.

Mixtures in which the different components are clearly visible are called heterogeneous mixtures. The prefix "hetero-" comes from the Greek word heteros, meaning "different."
Mixtures in which the components are blended together so well that the mixture looks like just one substance are called homogeneous mixtures. The prefix "homo- " comes from the Greek word homos, meaning "the same." Homogeneous mixtures are also called solutions.

A pure substance has a definite composition, which stays the same in response to physical changes. A lump of copper is a pure substance. Water (with nothing dissolved in it) is also a pure substance. Diamond, carbon dioxide, gold, oxygen, and aluminum are pure substances, too.

Pure substances are further classified into elements and compounds. An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated chemically into any simpler substances. Copper, zinc, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon are examples of elements.

A compound is a pure substance that results when two or more elements combine chemically to form a different substance. Compounds can be broken down into elements using chemical processes. For example, carbon dioxide is a compound. It can be separated into the elements carbon and oxygen.

**Matter**
anything that has mass and volume
found in three physical states: solid, liquid, gas

**Mixtures**
physical combinations of matter in which each component retains its identity
- **Heterogeneous Mixtures (Mechanical Mixtures)**: all components are visible
- **Homogeneous Mixtures (Solutions)**: components are blended so that it looks like a single substance.

**Pure Substances**
matter that has a definite composition
- **Elements**: matter that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances
- **Compounds**: matter in which two or more elements are chemically combined

The classification system for matter is based mainly on the changes that matter undergoes:
- physical changes to separate mixtures into elements or compounds
- chemical changes to convert compounds or elements into different compounds or elements

# Chapter 2

Helium, unlike hydrogen, does not burn. In fact, helium is a highly unreactive gas. The answer to why hydrogen is reactive and helium is unreactive lies in the structure of the atoms of these elements.

Elements are the basic substances that make up all matter. About 90 elements exist naturally in the universe. The two smallest and least dense of these elements are hydrogen and helium. Yet hydrogen and helium account for nearly $98\%$ of the mass of the entire universe!

Regardless of abundance, any two samples of hydrogen—from anywhere on Earth or far beyond in outer space—are identical to each other. This is because each element is made up of only a single kind of atom. For example, the element hydrogen contains only hydrogen atoms. The element helium contains only helium atoms.

# The Atomic Theory of Matter

John Dalton described atoms as solid, indestructible particles that make up all matter.

# Dalton's Atomic Theory (1809)

- All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. An atom cannot be created, destroyed, or divided into smaller particles.
- The atoms of one element cannot be converted into the atoms of any another element.
- All the atoms of one element have the same properties, such as mass and size. These properties are different from the properties of the atoms of any other element.
- Atoms of different elements combine in specific proportions to form compounds.

# The Modern View of the Atom

An atom is the smallest particle of an element that still retains the identity and properties of the element.
An average atom is about $10^{-10}$ m in diameter.
Atoms themselves are made up of even smaller particles. These subatomic particles are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons cluster together to form the central core, or nucleus, of an atom. Fast-moving electrons occupy the space that surrounds the nucleus of the atom. Subatomic particles are associated with electrical charges.

Table 2.1 Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

| Subatomic particle | Charge | Symbol | Mass (in g)        | Radius (in m)      |
| :----------------- | :----- | :----- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| electron           | 1-     | e-     | 9.02 × 10⁻²⁸       | smaller than 10⁻¹⁸ |
| proton             | 1+     | p+     | 1.67 × 10⁻²⁴       | 10⁻¹⁵              |
| neutron            | 0      | n0     | 1.67 × 10⁻²⁴       | 10⁻¹⁵              |

# Expressing the Mass of Subatomic Particles

One proton or neutron has a mass of $1.66 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{~g}$.
Chemists use a unit called an atomic mass unit (symbol $\mathbf{u}$). A proton has a mass of about $1\mathrm{u}$, which is equal to $1.66\times 10^{-24}\mathrm{g}$.
The number $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ is called the Avogadro constant.

The atomic theory was a convincing explanation of the behaviour of matter. It explained two established scientific laws: the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite composition.

- Law of conservation of mass: During a chemical reaction, the total mass of the substances involved does not change.
- Law of definite proportion: Elements always combine to form compounds in fixed proportions by mass. (For example, pure water always contains the elements hydrogen and oxygen, combined in the following proportions: $11\%$ hydrogen and $89\%$ oxygen.)

A proton is about 1837 times more massive than an electron. The mass of an electron is $9.02 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~g}$. This value is so small that scientists consider the mass of an electron to be approximately equal to zero. Thus, electrons are not taken into account when calculating the mass of an atom.

# The Nucleus of an Atom

All the atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in their nucleus. Chemists use the term atomic number (symbol $Z$) to refer to the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom of an element.
An element's mass number (symbol $A$) is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of one of its atoms. Each proton or neutron is counted as one unit of the mass number.
Information about an element's protons and neutrons is often summarized using chemical notation:
$^{A}_{Z}\mathrm{X}$
where X represents the atomic symbol for an element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number.
The number of neutrons can be calculated by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number:
Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number
$= A - Z$

# Using the Atomic Number to Infer the Number of Electrons

The atoms of each element are electrically neutral. This means that their positive charges (protons) and negative charges (electrons) must balance one another. In other words, in the neutral atom of any element, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons.

# Isotopes and Atomic Mass

The number of neutrons can vary. Isotopes are atoms of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
The isotopes of an element have very similar chemical properties because they have the same number of protons and electrons. They differ in mass, however, because they have different numbers of neutrons.
Some isotopes are more unstable than others. Their nuclei are more likely to decay, releasing energy and subatomic particles. This process, called radioactivity, happens spontaneously. Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes for short, have unstable nuclei. Many isotopes are not radioactive isotopes.
Radioisotopes decay because their nuclei are unstable. The time it takes for nuclei to decay varies greatly.

# Electrons in Atoms

Electrons occupy the space surrounding the nucleus. They are the first subatomic particles that are likely to interact when atoms come near one another. The number and arrangement of the electrons in an atom determine how the atom will react, if at all, with other atoms. Valence electrons are responsible for the chemical properties of the elements.

# Revisiting the Atomic Theory

The modern atomic theory retains many of Dalton's ideas, with only a few modifications:

- All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom is made up of smaller subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. (Modification: Although an atom is divisible, it is still the smallest particle of an element that has the properties and identity of the element.)
- The atoms of one element cannot be converted into the atoms of any another element by a chemical reaction. (Modification: Nuclear reactions (changes that alter the composition of the atomic nucleus) may, in fact, convert atoms of one element into atoms of another.)
- Atoms of one element have the same properties, such as average mass and size. These properties are different from the properties of the atoms of any other element. (Modification: Different isotopes of an element have different numbers of neutrons and thus different masses. Scientists treat elements as if their atoms have an average mass.)
- Atoms of different elements combine in specific proportions to form compounds. (This idea has remained basically unchanged.)

# 2.2 Atoms, Elements, and the Periodic Table

The term periodic means "repeating in an identifiable pattern."
One chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907), sequenced the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass. The result was a table of the elements, organized so that elements with similar properties were arranged in the same column. Because Mendeleev's arrangement highlighted periodic (repeating) patterns of properties, it was called a periodic table.
The modern periodic table is a modification of the arrangement first proposed by Mendeleev. Instead of organizing elements according to atomic mass, the modern periodic table organizes elements according to atomic number. According to the periodic law, the chemical and physical properties of the elements repeat in a regular, periodic pattern when they are arranged according to their atomic number.

# Key features of the modern periodic table:

- Each element is in a separate box, with its atomic number, atomic symbol, and atomic mass.
- Elements are arranged in seven numbered periods (horizontal rows) and 18 numbered groups (vertical columns).
- Groups are numbered according to two different systems: 1 to 18 (current) and I to VIII (older, with A and B categories).
- The elements in the eight A groups are the main-group elements, also called the representative elements.
- The elements in the ten B groups are known as the transition elements.
- Within the B group transition elements are two horizontal series of elements called inner transition elements. They usually appear below the main periodic table, fitting between the elements in Group 3 (IIIB) and Group 4 (IVB).
- A bold "staircase" line runs from the top of Group 13 (IIIA) to the bottom of Group 16 (VIA). This line separates the elements into three broad classes: metals, metalloids (or semi-metals), and non-metals.
- Group 1 (IA) elements are known as alkali metals. They react with water to form alkaline, or basic, solutions.
- Group 2 (IIA) elements are known as alkaline earth metals. They react with oxygen to form compounds called oxides, which react with water to form alkaline solutions.
- Group 17 (VIIA) elements are known as halogens, from the Greek word hals, meaning "salt." Elements in this group combine with other elements to form compounds called salts.
- Group 18 (VIII.A) elements are known as noble gases. Noble gases do not combine in nature with any other elements.

# Electrons and Energy Levels

Electrons cannot move haphazardly. Their movement around an atomic nucleus is restricted to fixed regions of space. These regions are three-dimensional, similar to the layers of an onion. These regions are called energy levels. An electron that is moving in a lower energy level is close to the nucleus. It has less energy than it would if it were moving in a higher energy level.
There is a limit to the number of electrons that can occupy each energy level. For example, a maximum of two electrons can occupy the first energy level. A maximum of eight electrons can occupy the second energy level.
A common way to show the arrangement of electrons in an atom is to draw circles around the atomic symbol. Each circle represents an energy level. Dots represent electrons that occupy each energy level. This kind of diagram is called a Bohr-Rutherford diagram.

# Patterns Based on Energy Levels and Electron Arrangements

**The Period-Related Pattern**
An element's period number is the same as the number of energy levels that the electrons of its atoms occupy. For example, Period 1 elements have electrons in one energy level, Period 2 elements have electrons in two energy levels, and so on.

**The Group-Related Pattern**
All the elements in each main group have the same number of electrons in their highest (outer) energy level. The electrons that occupy the outer energy level are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons involved when atoms form compounds and are responsible for the chemical behaviour of elements.
You can infer the number of valence electrons in any main-group element from its group number. For example, Group 1 (IA) elements have one valence electron. Group 2 (IIA) elements have two valence electrons. For elements in Groups 13 (IIIA) to 18 (VIIIA), the number of valence electrons is the same as the second digit in the current numbering system or the only digit in the older numbering system (e.g., Group 15 (VA) has 5 valence electrons).

# Using Lewis Structures to Represent Valence Electrons

Lewis structures are a simpler way to represent elements and the valence electrons of their atoms. To draw a Lewis structure, you replace the nucleus and inner energy levels of an atom with its atomic symbol. Then you place dots around the atomic symbol to represent the valence electrons.

# The Significance of a Full Outer Energy Level

The noble gases in Group 18 (VIIIA) are the only elements that exist as individual atoms in nature. They are extremely unreactive. All the noble gases have outer energy levels that are completely filled with the maximum number of electrons. Helium has a full outer energy level of two valence electrons. The other noble gases have eight valence electrons in the outer energy level. Chemists reason that having a full outer energy level must be a very stable electron arrangement.
When atoms have eight electrons in the outer energy level (or two electrons for hydrogen and helium), chemists say that they have a stable octet. Often this term is shortened to just octet. An octet is a very stable electron arrangement.

# 2.3 Periodic Trends Involving the Sizes and Energy Levels of Atoms

Chemists define, and measure, an atom's size in terms of its radius. The radius of an atom is the distance from its nucleus to the approximate outer boundary of the cloud-like region of its electrons.

# Trends for Atomic Size (Radius)

There are two general trends for atomic size:

- As you go down each group in the periodic table, the size of an atom increases. As you go down a group, the valence electrons occupy an energy level that is farther and farther from the nucleus. Thus, the valence electrons experience less attraction for the nucleus. In addition, electrons in the inner energy levels block, or shield, the valence electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. As a result, the total volume of the atom, and thus the size, increases with each additional energy level.
- As you go across a period, the size of an atom decreases. The positive charge on the nucleus also increases across a period. As well, without additional energy the electrons are restricted to their outer energy level. As a result, the positive force exerted by the nucleus pulls the outer electrons closer, reducing the atom's total size.

# Trends for Ionization Energy

A neutral atom contains equal numbers of positive charges (protons) and negative charges (electrons). The particle that results when a neutral atom gains electrons or gives up electrons is called an ion. Thus, an ion is a charged particle. An atom that gains electrons becomes a negatively charged anion. An atom that gives up electrons becomes a positively charged cation.
The metals that are main-group elements tend to give up electrons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases. Non-metals tend to gain electrons and form ions that have the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gases.
It takes energy to overcome the attractive force of a nucleus and pull an electron away from a neutral atom. The energy that is required to remove an electron from an atom is called ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove one electron from the outer energy level of the atoms of the main-group elements is called the first ionization energy. It is measured in units of $\mathrm{kJ / mol}$.
All elements, except hydrogen, have more than one electron that can be removed. Therefore, they have more than one ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove a second electron is called the second ionization energy. The energy that is needed to remove a third electron is the third ionization energy, and so on.

# Summarizing Trends for Ionization Energy

There are two general trends for ionization energy:

- Ionization energy tends to decrease down a group. Electrons in the outer energy level are farther from the positive force of the nucleus. Thus, they are easier to remove than electrons in lower energy levels.
- Ionization energy tends to increase across a period. As you go across a period, the attraction between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer energy level increases. Thus, more energy is needed to pull an electron away from its atom. A noble gas has the highest ionization energy of all the elements in the same period.

# Manitoba Mine Specializes in Rare Metals

Tantalum is a heavy, hard, and brittle grey metal. In its pure form, it is extremely ductile and can be made into a fine wire. It is resistant to corrosion by most acids, due to its very limited reactivity. At normal temperatures, tantalum is virtually non-reactive. Tantalum has about the same resistance to corrosion as glass, but can withstand higher temperatures. It has a melting point of $3290\mathrm{K}$ — higher than the melting points of all other elements, except tungsten and rhenium. Tantalum's resistance to corrosion and high melting point make it suitable for use in surgical equipment and implants, such as pins for broken bones, and surgical sutures. Tantalum is resistant to corrosion because a thin film of tantalum oxide forms when tantalum is exposed to oxygen, acting as a protective layer. The oxide also has special refractive properties that make it ideal for use in camera lenses.

Cesium is a silvery-white metal. It is found in a mineral called pollucite. Cesium is the softest of all the metals and is a liquid at just above room temperature. It is also the most reactive metal on Earth. Cesium has a low ionization energy. It readily gives up its single valence electron to form crystalline compounds with all the halogen non-metals. Cesium is also very photoelectric, meaning that it easily gives up its lone outer electron when it is exposed to light. Thus, cesium is used in television cameras and traffic signals, and has potential for use in ion propulsion engines for travel into deep space.

# Trends for Electron Affinity

Electron affinity is a measure of the change in energy that occurs when an electron is added to the outer energy level of an atom to form a negative ion. If energy is released when an atom of an element gains an electron, the electron affinity is expressed as a negative integer. When energy is absorbed when an electron is added, electron affinity is low, and is expressed as a positive integer. Fluorine has the highest electron affinity (large, negative integer), indicating it is very likely to be involved in chemical reactions and is the most reactive of all elements. Metals have very low electron affinities, especially Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements, forming stable positive ions.

# Analyzing the Ice Man's Axe

X-ray fluorescence is an analytical technique where an object is irradiated with high-energy X-ray radiation. Its atoms absorb the radiation, causing electrons from a lower energy level to be ejected from the atom. This causes electrons from an outer energy level to "move in," to occupy the vacated space. As the electrons fall to a less energetic state, they emit X-rays. The electrons of each atom emit X-rays of a particular wavelength. Scientists use this energy "signature" to identify the atom.

The trends for electron affinity are:

- Electron affinity tends to decrease down a group.
- Electron affinity tends to increase across a period.

# Section Wrap-up

Despite some irregularities and exceptions, the following periodic trends summarize the relationships among atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity:

- Trends for atomic size are the reverse of trends for ionization energy and electron affinity. Larger atoms tend to have lower ionization energies and lower electron affinities.
- Group 16 (VIA) and 17 (VIIA) elements attract electrons strongly. They do not give up electrons readily. In other words, they have a strong tendency to form negative ions. Thus, they have high ionization energies and high electron affinities.
- Group 1 (IA) and 2 (IIA) elements give up electrons readily. They have low or no attraction for electrons. In other words, they have a strong tendency to form positive ions. Thus, they have low ionization energies and low electron affinities.
- Group 18 (VIIIA) elements do not attract electrons and do not give up electrons. In other words, they do not naturally form ions. (They are very stable.) Thus, they have very high ionization energies and very low electron affinities.

# Chemical Compounds and Bonding

Gold, like all metals, is shiny, malleable, ductile, and a good conductor of electricity and heat. Most elements are chemically combined in the form of compounds.

# Classifying Chemical Compounds

Gold, silver, and platinum are three metals that can be found in Earth's crust as elements. Most other metals, and most other elements, are found in nature only as compounds.

Water, $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$, is a compound. Starch is a complex compound that consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is commonly called table salt. Pyrite (iron disulfide, $\mathrm{FeS}_2$) is a compound.

There are only about 90 naturally occurring elements. There are thousands upon thousands of different compounds in nature. Elements combine in many different ways to form the astonishing variety of natural and synthetic compounds.

Chemists have developed a classification system to organize compounds according to their properties, such as melting point, boiling point, hardness, conductivity, and solubility.

Humans have invented ways to extract iron from its compounds in order to take advantage of its properties. Iron forms rust, or iron(III) oxide, $\mathsf{Fe}_2\mathsf{O}_3$.

Based on their physical properties, compounds can be classified into two groups: ionic compounds and covalent compounds. Some of the properties of ionic and covalent compounds are summarized in Table 3.1.

Sodium chloride, NaCl, is a familiar compound, known as table salt. The sodium in sodium chloride plays a vital role in body functions. We need to ingest about $500\mathrm{mg}$ of sodium a day. Too much sodium chloride may contribute to high blood pressure. Sodium chloride is put on roads and sidewalks to melt the ice because salt water has a lower melting point than pure water.

Sodium chloride is a typical ionic compound. Like most ionic compounds, it is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It melts at a very high temperature, at $801^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. As well, it dissolves easily in water. A solution of sodium chloride in water is a good conductor of electricity. Liquid sodium chloride is also a good electrical conductor.

The cells of most organisms produce carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, during cellular respiration: the process that releases energy from food. Plants synthesize their own food from carbon dioxide and water using the Sun's energy.

Carbon dioxide has most of the properties of a typical covalent compound. It has a low melting point $(-79^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$. At certain pressures and temperatures, carbon dioxide is a liquid. Liquid carbon dioxide is a weak conductor of electricity. Carbon dioxide is somewhat soluble in water, especially at high pressures. A solution of carbon dioxide in water is a weak conductor of electricity.

Chemical bonds are the forces that attract atoms to each other in compounds. Bonding involves the interaction between the valence electrons of atoms. Usually the formation of a bond between two atoms creates a compound that is more stable than either of the two atoms on their own.

The different properties of ionic and covalent compounds result from the manner in which chemical bonds form between atoms in these compounds. Atoms can either exchange or share electrons.

When two atoms exchange electrons, one atom loses its valence electron(s) and the other atom gains the electron(s). This kind of bonding usually occurs between a metal and a non-metal. Metals have low ionization energies and non-metals have high electron affinities. That is, metals tend to lose electrons and non-metals tend to gain them. When atoms exchange electrons, they form an ionic bond.

Atoms can also share electrons. This kind of bond forms between two non-metals. It can also form between a metal and a non-metal when the metal has a fairly high ionization energy. When atoms share electrons, they form a covalent bond.

Examining the physical properties of a compound is one method to determine bond type, but it is not always satisfactory. Often a compound has some ionic characteristics and some covalent characteristics. For example, hydrogen chloride, also known as hydrochloric acid, has a low melting point and a low boiling point (it is a gas at room temperature), suggesting it is covalent. However, it is extremely soluble in water, and the water solution conducts electricity, which are characteristics of an ionic compound.

The electronegativity of an atom is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. EN is used to symbolize electronegativity. There is a specific electronegativity associated with each element.

Electronegativity is a periodic property. It increases up a group and across a period. The trend for electronegativity is the reverse of the trend for atomic size. In general, as atomic size decreases from left to right across a period, electronegativity increases. This is because the number of protons (which attract electrons) in the nucleus increases, while the number of filled, inner electron energy levels (which shield the protons from valence electrons) remains the same. Thus the electrons are pulled more tightly to the nucleus, resulting in a smaller atomic size. The atom attracts a bonding pair of electrons more strongly, because the bonding pair can move closer to the nucleus.

In the second period, lithium has the largest atomic size and the lowest electronegativity. As atomic size decreases across the second period, the electronegativity increases. Fluorine has the smallest atomic size in the third period (except for neon) and the highest electronegativity. Because noble gases do not usually participate in bonding, their electronegativities are not given.

Similarly, as atomic size increases down a group, electronegativity decreases. As you move down a group, valence electrons are less strongly attracted to the nucleus because the number of filled electron energy levels between the nucleus and the valence electrons increases. In a compound, increasing energy levels between valence electrons and the nucleus mean that the nucleus attracts bonding pairs less strongly.

For example, in Group 2 (IIA), beryllium has the smallest atomic radius and the largest electronegativity. As atomic size increases down the group, electronegativity decreases.

The relationship between atomic size and electronegativity for the main-group elements in periods 2 to 6 shows they are inversely related.

You can use the differences between electronegativities to decide whether the bond between two atoms is ionic or covalent. The symbol $\Delta EN$ stands for the difference between two electronegativity values. When calculating the electronegativity difference, the smaller electronegativity is always subtracted from the larger electronegativity, so that the electronegativity difference is always positive.

When two atoms have electronegativities that are identical, as in oxygen, they share their bonding pair of electrons equally between them in a covalent bond. When two atoms have electronegativities that are very different, as in potassium fluoride, the atom with the lower electronegativity loses an electron to the atom with the higher electronegativity. In potassium fluoride, potassium gives up its valence electron to fluorine. Therefore, the bond is ionic.

Atoms with different electronegativities can share electrons unequally without exchanging them.

Figure 3.8 shows the range of electronegativity differences. These values go from mostly covalent at 0.0 to mostly ionic at 3.3. Chemists consider bonds with an electronegativity difference that is greater than 1.7 to be ionic, and bonds with an electronegativity difference that is less than 1.7 to be covalent.

Table 3.2 shows how you can think of bonds as having a percent ionic character or percent covalent character, based on their electronegativity differences. When bonds have nearly $50\%$ ionic or covalent character, they have characteristics of both types of bonding.

Table 3.2 Character of Bonds

| Electronegativity difference | 0.00 | 0.65 | 0.94 | 1.19 | 1.43 | 1.67 | 1.91 | 2.19 | 2.54 | 3.03 |
| :--------------------------- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Percent ionic character      | 0%   | 10%  | 20%  | 30%  | 40%  | 50%  | 60%  | 70%  | 80%  | 90%  |
| Percent covalent character   | 100% | 90%  | 80%  | 70%  | 60%  | 50%  | 40%  | 30%  | 20%  | 10%  |

For the bond in hydrogen chloride, HCl, $\Delta EN$ is 0.96. This is lower than 1.7. Therefore, the bond in hydrogen chloride is a covalent bond.

# Ionic and Covalent Bonding: The Octet Rule

When atoms are bonded together, they are often more stable. Noble gases are the most stable elements in the periodic table because they are extremely unreactive and do not tend to form compounds. They have a filled outer electron energy level. When an atom loses, gains, or shares electrons through bonding to achieve a filled outer electron energy level, the resulting compound is often very stable.

According to the octet rule, atoms bond in order to achieve an electron configuration that is the same as the electron configuration of a noble gas. When two atoms or ions have the same electron configuration, they are said to be isoelectronic with one another. For example, $\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is isoelectronic with Ar because both have 18 electrons and a filled outer energy level. This rule is called the octet rule because all the noble gases (except helium) have eight electrons in their filled outer energy level. (Helium's outer electron energy level contains only two electrons.)

The electronegativity difference for the bond between sodium and chlorine is 2.1, indicating an ionic bond. Sodium has a very low electronegativity, and chlorine has a very high electronegativity. Therefore, when sodium and chlorine interact, sodium transfers its valence electron to chlorine. Sodium becomes $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and chlorine becomes $\mathrm{Cl^-}$.

The formation of an ionic bond between sodium and chlorine reflects the octet rule. Neutral sodium has one valence electron. When it loses this electron to chlorine, the resulting $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ cation has an electron energy level that contains eight electrons, making it isoelectronic with the noble gas neon. Chlorine has an outer electron energy level that contains seven electrons. When chlorine gains sodium's electron, it becomes an anion that is isoelectronic with the noble gas argon. The formation of an ionic bond can be represented using Lewis structures.

In an ionic bond, electrons are transferred from one atom to another so that they form oppositely charged ions. The strong force of attraction between the oppositely charged ions is what holds them together.

In sodium chloride, NaCl, one electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine. In order to satisfy the octet rule, two or three electrons may be transferred from one atom to another. For example, when magnesium and oxygen combine, the electronegativity difference for magnesium oxide is $3.4 - 1.3 = 2.1$, so it is an ionic compound. Magnesium contains two electrons in its outer shell. Oxygen contains six electrons in its outer shell. To become isoelectronic with a noble gas, magnesium needs to lose two electrons and oxygen needs to gain two electrons. Hence, magnesium transfers its two valence electrons to oxygen. Magnesium becomes $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and oxygen becomes $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$.

Sometimes ionic compounds contain more than one atom of each element. For example, in the compound formed from calcium and fluorine, the electronegativity difference is 3.0, indicating an ionic bond. Calcium has two electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs to lose two electrons according to the octet rule. Fluorine has seven electrons in its outer energy level, so it needs to gain one electron. Therefore, one calcium atom bonds with two fluorine atoms. Calcium loses one of each of its valence electrons to each fluorine atom. Calcium becomes $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, and fluorine becomes $\mathrm{F^{-}}$. They form the compound calcium fluoride, $\mathrm{CaF_2}$.

Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in their solid state. They are very good conductors in their liquid state or when they are dissolved in water. An electrical current can flow only if charged particles are available to move and carry the current. In the solid state, sodium and chlorine ions are bonded to each other by strong ionic bonds and are arranged in a rigid lattice formation. The ions cannot move very much, so there is no mobile charge. Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.

In molten sodium chloride, the rigid lattice structure is broken. The ions that make up the compound are free to move, and they easily conduct electricity. Similarly, when sodium chloride is dissolved, the sodium and chlorine ions are free to move. The solution is a good conductor of electricity.

When a clear solution of an ionic compound is poured over a seed crystal of the same compound, the ions align themselves according to the geometric arrangement in the seed crystal.

When the electronegativity difference between two atoms is very small or zero, they form covalent bonds. For example, each chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer energy level and needs to gain one electron to achieve a stable octet. When two chlorine atoms bond together, their electronegativity difference is zero, so the electrons are equally attracted to each atom. Instead of transferring electrons, the two atoms each share one electron with each other. A covalent bond consists of a pair of shared electrons. Thus, each chlorine atom achieves a filled outer electron energy level, satisfying the octet rule.

When two atoms of the same element form a bond, they share their electrons equally in a pure covalent bond. Elements with atoms that bond to each other in this way are known as diatomic elements. Some examples of diatomic elements are chlorine, $\mathsf{Cl}_2$, bromine, $\mathsf{Br}_2$, iodine, $\mathsf{I}_2$, nitrogen, $\mathsf{N}_2$, and hydrogen, $\mathsf{H}_2$.

When atoms such as carbon and hydrogen bond to each other, their electronegativities are so close that they share their electrons almost equally. Carbon and hydrogen have an electronegativity difference of only $2.6 - 2.2 = 0.4$. One atom of carbon forms a covalent bond with four atoms of hydrogen, forming methane, $\mathrm{CH}_4$. Each hydrogen atom shares one of its electrons with the carbon. The carbon shares one of its four valence electrons with each hydrogen. Thus, each hydrogen atom achieves a filled outer energy level, and so does carbon. When analyzing Lewis structures that show covalent bonds, count the shared electrons as if they belong to each of the bonding atoms.

In covalent bonding, atoms sometimes need to share two or three pairs of electrons, according to the octet rule. For example, in diatomic oxygen, each oxygen atom has six electrons in its outer energy level and requires two additional electrons to achieve a stable octet. When two oxygen atoms form a bond, they share two pairs of electrons. This kind of covalent bond is called a double bond.

Double bonds can form between different elements. For example, in carbon dioxide, carbon bonds to oxygen. To achieve a stable octet, carbon requires four electrons, and oxygen requires two electrons. Hence, two atoms of oxygen bond to one atom of carbon. Each oxygen forms a double bond with the carbon.

When atoms share three pairs of electrons, they form a triple bond. Diatomic nitrogen contains a triple bond.

Covalent compounds have a wider variety of properties than ionic compounds. Pure covalent compounds with bonds having an electronegativity difference less than 0.5, such as carbon disulfide, $\mathrm{CS}_2$, dichlorine monoxide, $\mathrm{Cl}_2\mathrm{O}$, and carbon tetrachloride, $\mathrm{CCl}_4$, generally have low boiling points and do not conduct electricity in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state.

The atoms in pure covalent compounds are held together by strong covalent bonds. These bonds do not break when the compound melts or boils. Covalent compounds do not break up into ions when they melt or boil. Instead, their atoms remain bonded together as molecules. For this reason, covalent compounds are also called molecular compounds. The molecules that make up a pure covalent compound cannot carry a current, even if the compound is in its liquid state or in solution.

Covalent compounds form liquids and solids at low temperatures, meaning something must hold the molecules together. The forces that bond the atoms to each other within a molecule are called intramolecular forces. Covalent bonds are intramolecular forces. In comparison, the forces that bond molecules to each other are called intermolecular forces. Because pure covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points, the intermolecular forces must be very weak compared with the intramolecular forces.

In metallic bonding, atoms release their electrons to a shared pool of electrons. A metal can be thought of as a non-rigid arrangement of metal ions in a sea of free electrons. The force that holds metal atoms together is called a metallic bond. Unlike ionic or covalent bonding, metallic bonding does not have a particular orientation in space. Because the electrons are free to move, the metal ions are not rigidly held in a lattice formation. Therefore, when a hammer pounds metal, the atoms can slide past one another, explaining why metals can be easily hammered into sheets.

Pure metals contain metallic bonds, as do alloys. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals. Each alloy has a uniform composition throughout. Bronze, an alloy, contains copper, tin, and lead, joined together with metallic bonds.

# 3.3

# Polar Covalent Bonds and Polar Molecules

When two bonding atoms have an electronegativity difference that is greater than 0.5 but less than 1.7, they are considered to form a polar covalent bond. In a polar covalent bond, the atoms have significantly different electronegativities. The electronegativity difference is not great enough for the less electronegative atom to transfer its valence electrons to the other, more electronegative atom. The difference is great enough for the bonding electron pair to spend more time near the more electronegative atom than the less electronegative atom.

For example, the bond between oxygen and hydrogen in water has an electronegativity difference of 1.24, making it a polar covalent bond. The oxygen attracts the electrons more strongly than the hydrogen. Therefore, the oxygen has a slightly negative charge and the hydrogen has a slightly positive charge. Since the hydrogen does not completely transfer its electron to the oxygen, their respective charges are not $+1$ and $-1$, but rather $\delta^{+}$ and $\delta^{-}$. The symbol $\delta^{+}$ (delta plus) stands for a partial positive charge. The symbol $\delta^{-}$ (delta minus) stands for a partial negative charge.

Different types of diagrams, or models, are useful for highlighting various aspects of molecules and bonding:
*   A Lewis structure shows exactly how many electrons are involved in each bond in a compound, including non-bonding pairs.
*   A structural diagram shows single bonds as single lines and multiple bonds as multiple lines, without non-bonding pairs.
*   A ball-and-stick model shows atoms as spheres and bonds as sticks, accurately showing bond orientation in three-dimensional space, though distances are exaggerated.
*   A space-filling model shows atoms as spheres and is the most accurate representation of the shape of a real molecule.

Molecules have different shapes. For example, water and carbon dioxide molecules have different shapes.

To understand why molecules have different shapes, consider how electron arrangement affects shape. The Lewis structure for water shows that the oxygen is surrounded by four electron pairs: two bonding pairs with hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs (not involved in bonding). Electron pairs are arranged around molecules so that they are a maximum distance from each other due to repulsion. The shape that allows four electron pairs to be a maximum distance from each other around an atom is a tetrahedron.

In a water molecule, the four electron pairs around the oxygen atom are arranged in a nearly tetrahedral shape. When only the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms are considered, the molecule has a bent shape due to the two lone pairs.

A carbon dioxide molecule has a linear shape. The central carbon atom is surrounded by eight electrons (four pairs), all involved in bonding (no lone pairs). The bonding electrons spend most of their time between the carbon and oxygen atoms, arranged in a straight line, allowing them to be as far away from each other as possible.

The shapes of the water molecule and the carbon dioxide molecule are supported by experiment.

The ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_3$, molecule has three bonding electron pairs and one lone pair on its central atom, all arranged in a nearly tetrahedral shape. Because there is one lone pair, the molecule's shape is pyramidal. The methane, $\mathrm{CH}_4$, molecule has four bonding pairs on its central atom and no lone pairs. It is shaped like a perfectly symmetrical tetrahedron.

Water molecules are attracted to one another. This attraction is evident in phenomena like water spray forming a "sheet," water bulging over a glass rim, and beads of water on surfaces.

A water molecule has a bent shape. Each oxygen-hydrogen bond is polar, with the hydrogen atom having a partial positive charge and the oxygen atom having a partial negative charge. Because the molecule is bent, there is a partial negative charge on the oxygen end and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen end.

Because the water molecule as a whole has a partial negative charge on one end and a partial positive charge on the other end, it is called a polar molecule. Because water is polar, its negative and positive ends attract each other, explaining why liquid water "sticks" to itself.

Two other examples of polar molecules are ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Polar molecules are also called dipolar molecules because they have a negative pole and a positive pole.

The bond between carbon and oxygen is polar, with an electronegativity difference of 1.0. However, carbon dioxide, a molecule that contains two carbon-oxygen double bonds, is a non-polar molecule. The oxygen atoms have partial negative charges, and the carbon atom has a partial positive charge. The molecule is straight and symmetrical, so the effects of the polar bonds cancel each other out. Therefore, while carbon dioxide contains polar bonds, it is a non-polar molecule. It has neither a positive pole nor a negative pole.

Carbon tetrafluoride, $\mathrm{CF_4}$, is another example of a non-polar molecule that contains polar bonds due to its symmetry.

Because water is made up of polar molecules with positive and negative ends that attract one another, water tends to "stick" to itself. This means that it has a high melting point and boiling point, relative to other covalent compounds. Carbon dioxide is made up of non-polar molecules. These molecules do not attract each other as much as polar molecules do, because they do not have positive and negative poles. Compounds that are made up of non-polar molecules generally have lower melting points and boiling points than compounds that are made up of polar molecules. Compounds with non-polar molecules, like carbon dioxide, are often gases at room temperature.

Differences in melting points and boiling points are due in part to the polarity of the molecules that make up the compounds. They are also due to the different masses of the individual molecules.

# Writing Chemical Formulas and Naming Chemical Compounds

Lewis structures are helpful for keeping track of electron transfers in bonding and for making sure that the octet rule is obeyed. Lewis structures can be used to help determine the ratio of the atoms in a compound.

A chemical formula provides two important pieces of information:
1. the elements that make up the compound
2. the number of atoms of each element that are present in a compound

The order in which the elements are written also communicates important information. The less electronegative element or ion is usually listed first in the formula, and the more electronegative element or ion comes second. For example, the ionic compound formed from calcium and bromine is written $\mathrm{CaBr}_2$. Calcium, a metal with low electronegativity, is written first. The subscript 2 after the bromine indicates that there are two bromine atoms for every calcium atom. When a subscript is omitted, only one atom is present per formula unit.

For covalent compounds, the chemical formula represents how many of each type of atom are in each molecule. For example, the formula $\mathrm{NH}_3$ signifies that a molecule of ammonia contains one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. The formula $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6$ tells you that a molecule of propane contains two atoms of carbon and six atoms of hydrogen.

For ionic compounds, the formula represents a ratio rather than a discrete particle. For example, the formula for magnesium oxide, MgO, signifies that magnesium and oxygen exist in a one-to-one atomic ratio. MgO exists in a lattice structure held together by ionic bonds. The formula MgO represents the ratio in which ions are present in the compound.

Every element has a certain capacity to combine with other atoms. A number is assigned to each element to describe the element's bonding capacity, called the valence. An atom of a Group 1 (IA) element has the capacity to lose one electron from its valence level. Thus, Group 1 (IA) elements, such as sodium and lithium, have a valence of $+1$. The 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. The + indicates that these elements tend to give up their electrons, becoming positively charged ions. They may transfer their electrons, or they may attract the electron relatively weakly in a polar covalent bond.

Group 17 (VIIA) elements (the halogens) have a valence of $-1$. The 1 indicates that these elements tend to have one electron involved in bonding. They need to gain an electron to achieve a stable octet. In general, halogens become more negatively charged when they participate in bonding.

As a general rule, if two atoms form an ionic bond, the valence tells you the charges on the ions that are formed. If a covalent bond is formed, the valence tells you how many electrons the atoms contribute to the covalent bond.

You can use the periodic table to predict valence numbers. For example, Group 2 (IIA) elements have two electrons in their outer energy level. To achieve a stable octet, they need to lose these two electrons. Therefore, the valence for all Group 2 elements is $+2$.

The smaller atoms of elements in the first two periods usually have only one common valence, which is easily determined from the periodic table. Many larger elements, however, have more than one valence because the electron distribution in these elements is much more complex. Some useful valences are listed in Table 3.3, with the most common valences listed first.

Table 3.3 Common Valences of Selected Elements

| 1     | 2     | 3-12 | 13    | 14        | 15    | 16    | 17    |

# Classifying Reactions: Chemicals in Balance

Chemical reactions are taking place everywhere. The cellulose in the firewood reacts with the oxygen in the air, producing carbon dioxide and water. The light and heat of the campfire are evidence of the chemical reaction. If someone roasts a marshmallow its sugars react with oxygen. The soft, white marshmallow forms a brown and brittle crust. When someone eats a marshmallow, the chemicals in the stomach react with the sugar molecules to digest them. A person telling a story exhales carbon dioxide with every breath. Carbon dioxide is the product of respiration, another chemical reaction.

In each star in the night sky above, another type of reaction is taking place. This type of reaction is called a nuclear reaction, because it involves changes within the nucleus of the atom. Nuclear reactions are responsible for the enormous amounts of heat and light generated by all the stars, including our Sun.

Chemical reactions are everywhere in our daily lives. We rely on chemical reactions for everything from powering a car to making toast.

## Chemical Equations

Interactions where elements and compounds interact with one another to form new substances are called chemical reactions. A substance that undergoes a chemical reaction is called a reactant. A substance that is formed in a chemical reaction is called a product.

For example, when the glucose in a marshmallow reacts with oxygen in the air to form water and carbon dioxide, the glucose and oxygen are the reactants. The carbon dioxide and water are the products. Chemists use chemical equations to communicate what is occurring in a chemical reaction. Chemical equations come in several forms. All of these forms condense a great deal of chemical information into a short statement.

### Word Equations

A word equation identifies the reactants and products of a chemical reaction by name. For example, chlorine and sodium combine to form the ionic compound sodium chloride. This reaction can be represented by the following word equation:

$$
\mathrm {s o d i u m} + \text {c h l o r i n e} \rightarrow \text {s o d i u m c h l o r i d e}
$$

In this equation, “+” means “reacts with” and “ $\rightarrow$ ” means “to form.”

Caffeine's chemical name is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthene.

Word equations are useful because they identify the products and reactants in a chemical reaction. They do not, however, provide any chemical information about the compounds and elements themselves. Another shortcoming of a word equation is that the names for chemicals are often very long and cumbersome. Chemists have therefore devised a more convenient way of representing reactants and products.

### Skeleton Equations

Using a chemical formula instead of a chemical name simplifies a chemical equation. It allows you to see at a glance what elements and compounds are involved in the reaction. A skeleton equation lists the chemical formula of each reactant on the left, separated by a + sign if more than one reactant is involved, followed by an arrow  $\rightarrow$ . The chemical formula of each product is listed on the right, again separated by a + sign if more than one product is produced. A skeleton equation also shows the state of each reactant by using the appropriate subscript, as shown in Table 4.1.

The reaction of sodium metal with chlorine gas to form sodium chloride can be represented by the following skeleton equation:

$$
\mathrm {N a} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {C l} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow \mathrm {N a C l} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

A skeleton equation is more useful to a chemist than a word equation, because it shows the formulas of the compounds involved. It also shows the state of each substance.

### Why Skeleton Equations Are Incomplete

Although skeleton equations are useful, they do not fully describe chemical reactions. For example, the skeleton equation showing the formation of sodium chloride: one sodium atom reacts with one chlorine molecule containing two chlorine atoms. The product is one formula unit of sodium chloride, containing one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine. This leaves an extra chlorine atom unaccounted for.

### The Law of Conservation of Mass

All atoms must be accounted for, according to an important law. The law of conservation of mass states that in any chemical reaction, the mass of the products is always equal to the mass of the reactants. In other words, according to this law, matter can be neither created nor destroyed. Chemical reactions proceed according to the law of conservation of mass, which is based on experimental evidence.

Table 4.1 Symbols
Used in Chemical Equations

| Symbol | Meaning                  |
| :----- | :----------------------- |
| +      | reacts with (reactant side) |
| +      | and (product side)       |
| →      | to form                  |
| (s)    | solid or precipitate     |
| (ℓ)    | liquid                   |
| (g)    | gas                      |
| (aq)   | in aqueous (water) solution |

Many chemical reactions can go in either direction, so an arrow pointing in the opposite direction is often added to the equation. This can look like  $\rightleftarrows$  or  $\rightleftharpoons$ . To indicate which reaction is more likely to occur, one arrow can be drawn longer than the other: for example:  $\rightleftarrows$  or  $\rightleftarrows$ .

### Balanced Chemical Equations

A balanced chemical equation reflects the law of conservation of mass. This type of equation shows that there is the same number of each kind of atom on both sides of the equation. Some skeleton equations are, by coincidence, already balanced. For example, the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide: one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms are on the left side of the equation, and one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms are on the right side of the equation.

Most skeleton equations, however, are not balanced, such as the one showing the formation of sodium chloride. There is one sodium atom on each side of the equation, but there are two chlorine atoms on the left side and only one chlorine atom on the right side.

To begin to balance an equation, you can add numbers in front of the appropriate formulas. The numbers that are placed in front of chemical formulas are called coefficients. They represent how many of each atom, molecule, or formula unit take part in each reaction. For example, if you add a coefficient of 2 to NaCl in the equation, you indicate that two formula units of NaCl are produced in the reaction.

You cannot balance an equation by changing any of the chemical formulas. The only way to balance a chemical equation is to put the appropriate numerical coefficient in front of each compound or element in the equation.

### Steps for Balancing Chemical Equations

More complex chemical equations can be balanced by using a combination of inspection and trial and error. Here, however, are some steps to follow.

Step 1 Write out the skeleton equation. Ensure that you have copied all the chemical formulas correctly.
Step 2 Begin by balancing the atoms that occur in the largest number on either side of the equation. Leave hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements until later.
Step 3 Balance any polyatomic ions, such as sulfate,  $\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$ , that occur on both sides of the chemical equation as an ion unit. That is, do not split a sulfate ion into 1 sulfur atom and 4 oxygen atoms. Balance this ion as one unit.
Step 4 Next, balance any hydrogen or oxygen atoms that occur in a combined and uncombined state. For example, combined oxygen might be in the form of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , while uncombined oxygen occurs as  $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ .
Step 5 Finally, balance any other element that occurs in its uncombined state: for example, Na or  $\mathrm{Cl}_2$ .
Step 6 Check your answer. Count the number of each type of atom on each side of the equation. Make sure that the coefficients used are whole numbers in their lowest terms.

### Sample Problem

**Balancing Chemical Equations**

**Problem**

$$

**What Is Required?**
The atoms of each element on the left side of the equation should equal the atoms of each element on the right side of the equation.

Balance the polyatomic ions first  $(\mathrm{NO}_3^-,$  then  $\mathrm{OH}^-$ ). Check to see whether the equation is balanced. If not, balance the potassium and copper ions. Check your equation again.

**Act on Your Strategy**
There are two  $\mathrm{NO}_3^-$  ions on the left, so put a 2 in front of  $\mathrm{KNO}_3$ .

$$
\mathrm {C u} \left(\mathrm {N O} _ {3}\right) _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {K O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {C u} (\mathrm {O H}) _ {2 (\mathrm {s})} + 2 \mathrm {K N O} _ {3 (\mathrm {a q})}
$$

To balance the two  $\mathrm{OH}^-$  ions on the right, put a 2 in front of the KOH.

$$
\mathrm {C u} \left(\mathrm {N O} _ {3}\right) _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} + 2 \mathrm {K O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {C u} (\mathrm {O H}) _ {2 (\mathrm {s})} + 2 \mathrm {K N O} _ {3 (\mathrm {a q})}
$$

Check to see that the copper and potassium ions are balanced. They are, so the equation above is balanced.

**Check Your Solution**
Tally the number of each type of atom on each side of the equation.

$$
\mathrm {C u} \left(\mathrm {N O} _ {3}\right) _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} + 2 \mathrm {K O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {C u} (\mathrm {O H}) _ {2 (\mathrm {s})} + 2 \mathrm {K N O} _ {3 (\mathrm {a q})}
$$

**Left Side**
Cu 1
NO3 2
K 2
OH- 2

**Right Side**
Cu 1
NO3 2

OH- 2

The fraction  $\frac{5}{10}$ , expressed in lowest terms, is  $\frac{1}{2}$ . Similarly, the equation  $4\mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{g})} + 2\mathrm{O}_{2(\mathrm{g})} \rightarrow 4\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_{(\ell)}$  is balanced, but it can be simplified by dividing all the coefficients by two.  $2\mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{g})} + \mathrm{O}_{2(\mathrm{g})} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_{(\ell)}$ .

## Synthesis and Decomposition Reactions

Just as there are different types of compounds, there are different types of chemical reactions. By classifying, one can recognize similarities between chemical reactions and the types of reactants that tend to undergo different types of reactions. With this knowledge, one can predict what will happen when one, two, or more substances react.

### Synthesis Reactions

In a synthesis reaction, two or more elements or compounds combine to form a new substance. Synthesis reactions are also known as combination or formation reactions. A general equation for a synthesis reaction is

$$
\mathrm {A} + \mathrm {B} \rightarrow \mathrm {C}
$$

In a simple synthesis reaction, one element reacts with one or more other elements to form a compound. Two, three, four, or more elements may react to form a single product, although synthesis reactions involving four or more reactants are extremely rare. When two elements react together, the reaction is almost always a synthesis reaction because the product is almost always a single compound. There are several types of synthesis reactions. Recognizing the patterns of the various types of reactions will help you to predict whether substances will take part in a synthesis reaction.

When a metal or a non-metal element reacts with oxygen, the product is an oxide. For example, iron reacts with oxygen according to the following equation:

$$
3 \mathrm {F e} _ {\mathrm {(s)}} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 \mathrm {(g)}} \rightarrow \mathrm {F e} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {3 \mathrm {(s)}}
$$

Two other examples of this type of reaction are:

$$
2 \mathrm {H} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\mathrm {g})}
$$

$$
2 \mathrm {M g} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {M g O} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

A second type of synthesis reaction involves the reaction of a metal and a non-metal to form a binary compound. One example is the reaction of potassium with chlorine.

$$
2 \mathrm {K} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {C l} _ {2 \left(\mathrm {g}\right)} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {K C l} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

### Synthesis Reactions Involving Compounds

There are many synthesis reactions in which one or more compounds are the reactants. For the purpose of this course, however, we will deal only with the two specific types of synthesis reactions involving compounds that you should recognize: oxides and water.

When a non-metallic oxide reacts with water, the product is an acid. The acids that form when non-metallic oxides and water react are composed of hydrogen cations and polyatomic anions containing oxygen and a non-metal. For example, one contributor to acid rain is hydrogen sulfate (sulfuric acid),  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{SO}_4$ , which forms when sulfur trioxide reacts with water.

$$
\mathrm {S O} _ {3 (\mathrm {g})} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\ell)} \rightarrow \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {S O} _ {4 (\mathrm {a q})}
$$

Conversely, when a metallic oxide reacts with water, the product is a metal hydroxide. Metal hydroxides belong to a group of compounds called bases. For example, when calcium oxide reacts with water, it forms calcium hydroxide,  $\mathrm{Ca(OH)_2}$ . Calcium oxide is also called lime. It can be added to lakes to counteract the effects of acid precipitation.

$$
\mathrm {C a O} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {\left(\ell\right)} \rightarrow \mathrm {C a} (\mathrm {O H}) _ {2 \left(\mathrm {a q}\right)}
$$

Sometimes it is difficult to predict the product of a synthesis reaction. The only way to really know the product of a reaction is to carry out the reaction and then isolate and identify the product. For example, carbon can react with oxygen to form either carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. Therefore, if all you know is that your reactants are carbon and oxygen, you cannot predict with certainty which compound will form. You can only give options.

$$
\mathrm {C} _ {\mathrm {(s)}} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 \mathrm {(g)}} \rightarrow \mathrm {C O} _ {2 \mathrm {(g)}}
$$

$$
2 \mathrm {C} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {C O} _ {\left(\mathrm {g}\right)}
$$

You would need to analyze the products of the reaction by experiment to determine which compound was formed.

### Decomposition Reactions

In a decomposition reaction, a compound breaks down into elements or other compounds. Therefore, a decomposition reaction is the opposite of a synthesis reaction. A general formula for a decomposition reaction is:

$$
\mathrm {C} \rightarrow \mathrm {A} + \mathrm {B}
$$

The substances that are produced in a decomposition reaction can be elements or compounds. In the simplest type of decomposition reaction, a compound breaks down into its component elements. One example is the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. This reaction occurs when electricity is passed through water.

$$
2 \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {H} _ {2} + \mathrm {O} _ {2}
$$

More complex decomposition reactions occur when compounds break down into other compounds. An example of this type of reaction is the explosive decomposition of ammonium nitrate.

When ammonium nitrate is heated to a high temperature, it forms dinitrogen monoxide and water according to the following balanced equation:

$$
\mathrm {N H} _ {4} \mathrm {N O} _ {3 (\mathrm {s})} \rightarrow \mathrm {N} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\mathrm {g})} + 2 \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\mathrm {g})}
$$

### Combustion Reactions

A complete combustion reaction is the reaction of a compound or element with  $\mathrm{O}_2$  to form the most common oxides of the elements that make up the compound. For example, a carbon-containing compound undergoes combustion to form carbon dioxide,  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ . A sulfur-containing compound reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide,  $\mathrm{SO}_2$ .

Combustion reactions are usually accompanied by the production of light and heat. In the case of carbon-containing compounds, complete combustion results in the formation of, among other things, carbon dioxide. For example, methane,  $\mathrm{CH}_4$ , the primary constituent of natural gas, undergoes complete combustion to form carbon dioxide, (the most common oxide of carbon), as well as water. This combustion reaction is represented by the following equation:

$$
\mathrm {C H} _ {4 (\mathrm {g})} + 2 \mathrm {O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow \mathrm {C O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} + 2 \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\mathrm {g})}
$$

The complete combustion of any compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (such as ethanol,  $\mathrm{C_2H_5OH}$ ) produces carbon dioxide and water.

Compounds that contain elements other than carbon also undergo complete combustion to form stable oxides. For instance, sulfur-containing compounds undergo combustion to form sulfur dioxide,  $\mathrm{SO}_2$ , a precursor to acid rain. Complete combustion reactions are often also synthesis reactions. Metals, such as magnesium, undergo combustion to form their most stable oxide.

$$
2 \mathrm {M g} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {M g O} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

In the absence of sufficient oxygen, carbon-containing compounds undergo incomplete combustion, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide, CO, and water. Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas.

## Single Displacement and Double Displacement Reactions

### Single Displacement Reactions

In a single displacement reaction, one element in a compound is displaced (or replaced) by another element. Two general reactions represent two different types of single displacement reactions. One type involves a metal replacing a metal cation in a compound, as follows:

$$
\mathrm {A} + \mathrm {B C} \rightarrow \mathrm {A C} + \mathrm {B}
$$

For example,  $\mathrm{Zn}_{(\mathrm{s})} + \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_{2(\mathrm{aq})}\rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_{2(\mathrm{aq})} + \mathrm{Fe}_{2(\mathrm{s})}$

The second type of single displacement reaction involves a non-metal (usually a halogen) replacing an anion in a compound, as follows:

$$
\mathrm {D E} + \mathrm {F} \rightarrow \mathrm {D F} + \mathrm {E}
$$

For example,  $\mathrm{Cl}_{2(\mathrm{g})} + \mathrm{CaBr}_{2(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCl}_{2(\mathrm{aq})} + \mathrm{Br}_{2(\ell)}$

### Single Displacement Reactions and the Metal Activity Series

Most single displacement reactions involve one metal displacing another metal from a compound. In the following equation, magnesium metal replaces the zinc in  $\mathrm{ZnCl}_2$ , thereby liberating zinc as the free metal.

$$
\mathrm {M g} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {Z n C l} _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {M g C l} _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {Z n} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

The following three reactions illustrate the various types of single displacement reactions involving metals:

1.  $\mathrm{Cu}_{(\mathrm{s})} + 2\mathrm{AgNO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}\rightarrow \mathrm{Cu(NO_3)_2(aq)} + 2\mathrm{Ag(s)}$
    In this reaction, one metal replaces another metal in an ionic compound. That is, copper replaces silver in  $\mathrm{AgNO_3}$ . Because of the  $+2$  charge on the copper ion, it requires two nitrate ions to balance its charge.
2.  $\mathrm{Mg}_{(\mathrm{s})} + 2\mathrm{HCl}_{(\mathrm{aq})}\rightarrow \mathrm{MgCl}_{2(\mathrm{aq})} + \mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{g})}$
    In this reaction, magnesium metal replaces hydrogen from hydrochloric acid,  $\mathrm{HCl}_{\mathrm{(aq)}}$ . Since hydrogen is diatomic, it is "liberated" in the form of  $\mathrm{H}_2$ . This reaction is similar to reaction 1 if
    *   you treat hydrochloric acid as an ionic compound (which it technically is not), and if
    *   you treat hydrogen as a metal (also, technically, not the case).
3.  $2\mathrm{Na}_{(\mathrm{s})} + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_{(\ell)} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{NaOH}_{(\mathrm{aq})} + \mathrm{H}_{2(\mathrm{g})}$
    Sodium metal displaces hydrogen from water in this reaction. Again, since hydrogen is diatomic, it is produced as  $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ . As above, you can understand this reaction better if
    *   you treat hydrogen as a metal, and if
    *   you treat water as an ionic compound,  $\mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{OH}^{-})$ .

All of the reactions just described follow the original general example of a single displacement reaction:

$$
\mathrm {A} + \mathrm {B C} \rightarrow \mathrm {A C} + \mathrm {B}
$$

When analyzing single displacement reactions, use the following guidelines:

*   Treat hydrogen as a metal.
*   Treat acids, such as HCl, as ionic compounds of the form  $\mathrm{H}^{+}\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ . (Treat sulfuric acid,  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ , as  $\mathrm{H}^{+}\mathrm{H}^{+}\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ ).
*   Treat water as ionic, with the formula  $\mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{OH}^{-})$ .

A single displacement reaction always favours the production of the less reactive metal. In other words, the "free" metal that is formed from the compound must always be less reactive than the metal that displaced it. For example,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 \mathrm {A g N O} _ {3 (\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {C u} _ {(\mathrm {s})} \rightarrow \\ \mathrm {C u} \left(\mathrm {N O} _ {3}\right) _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})} + 2 \mathrm {A g} (\mathrm {s}) \\ \end{array}
$$

Silver metal is more stable than copper metal. In other words, silver is below copper in the activity series.

### The Metal Activity Series

As you can see in Table 4.2, the more reactive metals are at the top of the activity series. The less reactive metals are at the bottom. A reactive metal will displace or replace any metal in a compound that is below it in the activity series. Metals from lithium to sodium will displace hydrogen as a gas from water. Metals from magnesium to lead will displace hydrogen as a gas only from acids. Copper, mercury, silver, and gold will not displace hydrogen from acids.

Most metals that we use in everyday life are actually alloys. An alloy is a solid solution of one metal (or nonmetal) in another metal. For example, steel is an alloy of iron. Steel has many uses, from construction to the automobile industry. If the iron were not alloyed with other elements, it would not have the physical and chemical properties required, such as hardness and corrosion resistance.

You can use the activity series to help you predict the products of the reaction of a metal and a metal-containing compound. For example, consider the following incomplete equation.

$$
\mathrm {F e} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {C u S O} _ {4 (\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow
$$

You can see from the activity series that iron is above copper. This means that iron is more reactive than copper. This reaction will proceed.

$$
\mathrm {F e} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {C u S O} _ {4 (\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {F e S O} _ {4 (\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {C u} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)}
$$

The copper metal produced is less reactive than iron metal. What about the following incomplete reaction between silver and calcium chloride?

$$
\mathrm {A g} _ {\left(\mathrm {s}\right)} + \mathrm {C a C l} _ {2 \left(\mathrm {a q}\right)} \rightarrow
$$

Silver is below calcium in the activity series, meaning that it is less reactive. There would be no reaction between these two substances.

### Single Displacement Reactions Involving Halogens

Non-metals, typically halogens, can also take part in single displacement reactions. For example, molecular chlorine can replace bromine from KBr, an ionic compound, producing bromine and potassium chloride.

$$
\mathrm {C l} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} + 2 \mathrm {K B r} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {K C l} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {B r} _ {2 (\ell)}
$$

The activity series for halogens directly mirrors the position of halogens in the periodic table. It can be shown simply in the following way. Fluorine is the most reactive, and iodine is the least reactive.

$$
\mathrm {F} > \mathrm {C l} > \mathrm {B r} > \mathrm {I}
$$

In the same way as you used the activity series for metals, you can use the activity series for halogens to predict whether substances will undergo a single displacement reaction. For example, fluorine is above chlorine in the activity series. So, given the reactants fluorine and sodium chloride, you can predict that the following reaction will occur:

$$
\mathrm {F} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})} + 2 \mathrm {N a C l} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm {N a F} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {C l} _ {2 (\mathrm {a q})}
$$

On the other hand, iodine is below bromine in the activity series. So, given the reactants

# Chapter 5

The baking soda reacts with acetic acid in the vinegar to produce carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas helps the batter rise. The chemical equation for this reaction is

$$
\mathrm {N a H C O} _ {3 (\mathrm {s})} + \mathrm {C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {N a C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\ell)} + \mathrm {C O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})}
$$

According to the balanced equation, one molecule of baking soda reacts with one molecule of acetic acid to form a salt, water, and carbon dioxide.

The head of a pin, made primarily of iron, has a mass of about $8 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~g}$, yet it contains about $8 \times 10^{19}$ atoms. The mass of a single iron atom is about $1 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{~g}$.

**Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses**

The mass of an atom is expressed in atomic mass units (u). Atomic mass units are a relative measure, defined by the mass of carbon-12. One atom of carbon-12 is assigned a mass of $12\mathrm{u}$. Stated another way, $1\mathrm{u} = \frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

The masses of all other atoms are defined by their relationship to carbon-12. For example, oxygen-16 has a mass that is $133\%$ of the mass of carbon-12. Hence the mass of an atom of oxygen-16 is

$$
\frac {1 3 3}{1 0 0} \times 1 2. 0 0 0 \mathrm {u} = 1 6. 0 \mathrm {u}.
$$

Atoms of the same element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up of two or more isotopes.

**Isotopic Abundance**

Magnesium has three naturally occurring isotopes: $79\%$ magnesium-24, $10\%$ magnesium-25, and $11\%$ magnesium-26. This proportion is constant regardless of the source of magnesium. The relative amount in which each isotope is present in an element is called the isotopic abundance. It can be expressed as a percent or as a decimal fraction.

Magnesium plays a variety of roles in the body. It is involved in energy production, nerve function, and muscle relaxation. The magnesium in these tablets, like all naturally occurring magnesium, is made up of three isotopes.

**Average Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table**

The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses of all the element's isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of each isotope within the element. The average atomic mass is the mass that is given for each element in the periodic table.

The average atomic mass of carbon is $12.01\mathrm{u}$. No one atom of carbon has a mass of $12.01\mathrm{u}$. Carbon is made up of several isotopes: carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. Carbon-12 comprises $98.9\%$ of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for $1.1\%$. Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount—about $1 \times 10^{-10}\%$. The average mass of all the isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u, which is very close to 12, since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.

The only elements with only one naturally occurring isotope are beryllium, sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus.

Chemists use a mass spectrometer, a powerful instrument that generates a magnetic field, to obtain data about the mass and abundance of atoms and molecules.

**Working with Weighted Averages**

A weighted average takes into account not only the values associated with a set of data, but also the abundance or importance of each value.

To calculate the average of a set of data with equal weight, you add the given values and divide the total by the number of values in the set. For example, for objects A (1.0 kg), B (2.0 kg), and C (3.0 kg), the equally weighted average mass is:
$\frac {1 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 . 0 \mathrm {k g}}{3} = 2. 0 \mathrm {k g}$

For a set containing two of A, one of B, and three of C, the weighted average mass is:
$\frac {2 (1 . 0 \mathrm {k g}) + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 (3 . 0 \mathrm {k g})}{6} = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}$

Alternatively, considering relative abundance: A is $\frac{2}{6}$ (33%), B is $\frac{1}{6}$ (17%), and C is $\frac{3}{6}$ (50%). The average mass is:
$(0. 3 3) (1. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 1 7) (2. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 5 0) (3. 0 \mathrm {k g}) = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}$

**Calculating Average Atomic Mass**

If the atomic mass of each isotope and its isotopic abundance are known, the average atomic mass of the element can be calculated.

For example, lithium exists as two isotopes: lithium-7 (mass 7.015 u, $92.58\%$ abundance) and lithium-6 (mass 6.015 u, $7.42\%$ abundance). The average atomic mass of lithium is calculated as:
$\left(\frac {9 2 . 5 8}{1 0 0}\right) (7. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) + \left(\frac {7 . 4 2}{1 0 0}\right) (6. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) = 6. 9 4 \mathrm {u}$
The periodic table confirms the average atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 u.

**The Mass Spectrometer**

Mass spectrometers can detect trace pollutants, provide information about large molecules, and help determine the age of Earth's oldest rocks. They find the relative abundance of each isotope in an element. J.J. Thompson first detected neon-20 and neon-22 in 1912 using a magnetic field to separate isotopes.

Today's mass spectrometers also use a magnetic field to separate ions. Atoms must first be charged, or "ionized," because a magnetic field only affects charged particles. The magnetic field then deflects ions with the same charge but different masses onto separate paths. Lighter ions curve more than heavier ions.

Elements that are not gases are vaporized by heating. Gas atoms are then ionized, typically by electron impact ionization, where electrons from a heated filament collide with gas atoms, causing them to lose an electron and become positive ions.

The ions are focused and accelerated by electric fields toward a magnetic field. The magnetic field deflects them, forcing them into a curved path. Ions from different isotopes arrive at different destinations. A detector registers the current at each destination, which is proportional to the number of ions. An isotope with a larger relative abundance generates a larger current. From these currents, chemists deduce the proportion of each isotope.

Mass spectral data for neon show the relative abundance of its isotopes. Chemists now detect neon-21, in addition to neon-20 and neon-22.

**Example: Average Atomic Mass Calculation**
Naturally occurring silver exists as two isotopes: $^{107}_{47}\mathrm{Ag}$ (106.9 u, 51.8% abundance) and $^{109}_{47}\mathrm{Ag}$ (108.9 u, 48.2% abundance).
Average atomic mass of $\mathrm{Ag} = 106.9\mathrm{u}(0.518) + 108.9\mathrm{u}(0.482) = 107.9 \mathrm {u}$.
The periodic table shows the average atomic mass of silver as 107.9 u.

**Fact about Atomic Masses**
The atomic masses of individual isotopes are not exact whole numbers (except for carbon-12). Protons and neutrons have masses close to, but slightly different from, 1 u. The mass of electrons, though much smaller, must also be taken into account.

**Calculating Isotopic Abundance**

Knowing the average atomic mass of an element and the masses of its isotopes, the isotopic abundances can be calculated.

**Example: Isotopic Abundance Calculation**
Boron exists as two naturally occurring isotopes: ${}^{10}_{5}\mathrm{B}$ (10.01 u) and ${}^{11}_{5}\mathrm{B}$ (11.01 u). The average atomic mass of boron is 10.81 u.
Let the abundance of boron-10 be $x$ and boron-11 be $1-x$.
Average atomic mass $= x$ (atomic mass B-10) + $(1 - x)$ (atomic mass B-11)
$10.81 = x (10.01) + (1 - x) (11.01)$
$10.81 = 10.01x + 11.01 - 11.01x$
$11.01x - 10.01x = 11.01 - 10.81$
$x = 0.2000$
The abundance of boron-10 is 0.2000 (20.00%).
The abundance of boron-11 is $1 - 0.2000 = 0.8000$ (80.00%).
This makes sense because the average atomic mass (10.81 u) is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.

Boron is part of boric acid, $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{BO}_3$, which is contained in many cleaning solutions for contact lenses.

In some periodic tables, the average atomic mass is referred to as the atomic weight of an element.

**The Avogadro Constant and the Mole**

Chemical reactions depend on the number of atoms present, not on their masses. Since atoms are too small and numerous to count individually, a way to relate the numbers of atoms to measurable masses is needed.

**The Definition of the Mole**

Chemists use the mole (symbol mol) to group atoms and molecules.
- One mole (1 mol) of a substance contains $6.022 141 99 \times 10^{23}$ particles of the substance. This value is called the Avogadro constant, symbol $N_{\mathrm{A}}$.
- The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or formula units) as exactly $12\mathrm{g}$ of carbon-12.

For example, one mole of carbon contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ atoms of C. One mole of sodium chloride contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ formula units of NaCl. One mole of hydrofluoric acid contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of HF.

The Avogadro constant is an experimentally determined quantity.

**The Chemist's Dozen**

The mole is analogous to a "dozen" for chemists. Just as 2 dozen eggs means 24 eggs, 2 mol of aluminum atoms contain $2 \times (6.02 \times 10^{23}) = 1.20 \times 10^{24}$ atoms of Al.

**How Big Is the Avogadro Constant?**

The Avogadro constant is a huge number ($6.02 \times 10^{23}$). This magnitude is necessary to group single atoms into convenient amounts.
Samples of elements containing $1.00\mathrm{mol}$ or $6.02\times 10^{23}$ atoms have different masses.

**Example: Using the Avogadro Constant**
The distance from St. John's to Vancouver is $5046\mathrm{km}$. A round trip is $10092\mathrm{km}$.
If 1 mol of peas, each of diameter 1 cm, were laid end to end, how many round trips could be made?
Round trip distance in cm: $(10092 \mathrm{km}) \times (10^5 \mathrm{cm/km}) = 1.01 \times 10^9 \mathrm{cm}$.
Length of 1 mol of peas: $6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}$.
Number of round trips $= \frac {6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {c m}}{\left(1 . 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {9} \mathrm {c m} / \text {r o u n d t r i p}\right)} = 5. 9 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 4} \mathrm {r o u n d t r i p s}$.
About 596 trillion round trips could be made.

**Converting Moles to Number of Particles**

The relationship between moles, number of particles, and the Avogadro constant is:
$N = n \times N_{\mathrm{A}}$
where $N$ is the number of particles, $n$ is the number of moles, and $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the Avogadro constant ($6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles/mol).

**Example: Moles to Atoms**
A sample contains $1.25\mathrm{mol}$ of nitrogen dioxide, $\mathrm{NO}_2$.
(a) Number of molecules in the sample:
$(1. 2 5 \mathrm {m o l}) \times \left(6. 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \frac {\text {m o l e c u l e s}}{\mathrm {m o l}}\right) = 7. 5 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}$.
(b) Number of atoms in the sample (each $\mathrm{NO}_2$ molecule has 3 atoms):
$(7.52 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{molecules}) \times \left(3 \frac{\mathrm{atoms}}{\mathrm{molecule}}\right) = 2.26 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{atoms}$.

**Converting Number of Particles to Moles**

Chemists typically use units of moles to express amounts of substances. To convert the number of particles in a substance to the number of moles, the equation is rearranged:
$n = \frac {N}{N _ {\mathrm {A}}}$

**Example: Molecules to Moles**
How many moles are present in a sample of carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, made up of $5.83 \times 10^{24}$ molecules?
$n = \frac {5 . 8 3 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s C O} _ {2}}{\left(6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s C O} _ {2} / \mathrm {m o l C O} _ {2}\right)} = 9. 6 8 \mathrm {m o l} \mathrm {C O} _ {2}$.

The Avogadro constant is named to honour the Italian chemist Amedeo Avogadro. In 1811, Avogadro postulated Avogadro's law: Equal volumes of gases, at equal temperatures and pressures, contain the same number of molecules.

**Molar Mass**

One atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly $12\mathrm{u}$. By definition, one mole of carbon-12 atoms ($6.02\times 10^{23}$ carbon-12 atoms) has a mass of exactly $12\mathrm{g}$.
The Avogadro constant is the factor that converts the relative mass of individual atoms or molecules, expressed in atomic mass units, to mole quantities, expressed in grams.

The periodic table gives the average mass of a single atom in atomic mass units (u). One mole of an element has a mass expressed in grams numerically equivalent to the element's average atomic mass expressed in atomic mass units. For example, zinc has an average atomic mass of 65.39 u, so one mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g.

The mass of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass (symbol $M$). Molar mass is expressed in g/mol. For example, the average atomic mass of gold is 196.97 u, so gold's molar mass is 196.97 g/mol.

**Table: Average Atomic Mass and Molar Mass of Four Elements**
| Element        | Average atomic mass (u) | Molar mass (g/mol) |
| :------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------- |
| hydrogen, H    | 1.01                    | 1.01               |
| oxygen, O      | 16.00                   | 16.00              |
| sodium, Na     | 22.99                   | 22.99              |
| argon, Ar      | 39.95                   | 39.95              |

**Finding the Molar Mass of Compounds**

To find the molar mass of a compound, add the molar masses of each element it contains, multiplied by their respective subscripts in the chemical formula.
For example, 1 mol of beryllium oxide, BeO, contains 1 mol of beryllium and 1 mol of oxygen.
$M _ {\mathrm {B e O}} = 9. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} + 1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} = 2 5. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and most other standardization bodies use $M$ to represent molar mass.

**Example: Molar Mass of a Compound**
What is the mass of one mole of calcium phosphate, $\mathrm{Ca}_3(\mathrm{PO}_4)_2$?
The formula indicates 3 mol of calcium, 2 mol of phosphorus, and 8 mol of oxygen.
$M _ {\mathrm {C a}} \times 3 = (4 0. 0 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 3 = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {P}} \times 2 = (3 0. 9 7 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 2 = 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {O}} \times 8 = (1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 8 = 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$
$M _ {\mathrm {C a} _ {3} (\mathrm {P O} _ {4}) _ {2}} = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g / m o l} = 3 1 0. 1 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}$.
The molar mass of calcium phosphate is $310.18\mathrm{g / mol}$.

**Counting Particles Using Mass**

One mole of any compound or element contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles. The compound or element has a mass, in grams, determined from the periodic table.
For carbon dioxide, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$: $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 1$ mol of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 44.0\mathrm{g}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
The molar mass relates the amount of an element or a compound, in moles, to its mass. The Avogadro constant relates the number of particles to the molar amount.

**Converting from Moles to Mass**

The equation used to solve problems involving mass, molar mass, and number of moles is:
Mass = Number of moles $\times$ Molar mass
$m = n \times M$

**Example: Moles to Mass**
A flask contains $0.750 \, \mathrm{mol}$ of carbon dioxide gas, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. What mass of carbon dioxide gas is in this sample?
Molar mass of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} = (2 \times 16.00 \mathrm{g/mol}) + 12.01 \mathrm{g/mol} = 44.01 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
$m = (0. 7 5 0 \mathrm {mol}) \times (4 4. 0 1 \mathrm {g / mol}) = 3 3. 0 \mathrm {g}$.
The mass of $0.75\mathrm{mol}$ of carbon dioxide is $33.0\mathrm{g}$.

**Converting from Mass to Moles**

To calculate the number of moles in a sample, divide the mass of the sample by its molar mass.
$n = \frac {m}{M}$

**Example: Mass to Moles**
How many moles of acetic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$, are in a $23.6\mathrm{g}$ sample?
The molar mass of $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$ is $(12.01 \times 2) + (16.00 \times 2) + (1.01 \times 4) = 60.06 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
$n = \frac {2 3 . 6 \mathrm {g}}{6 0 . 0 6 \mathrm {g / m o l}} = 0. 3 9 3 \mathrm {m o l}$.
There are $0.393\mathrm{mol}$ of acetic acid in $23.6\mathrm{g}$ of acetic acid.

**Chemical Amounts in Vitamin Supplements**
Vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) regulate metabolism, build blood and bone, and maintain muscles and nerves. Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) outlines daily micronutrient amounts.
The form of a mineral in supplements affects its bioavailability. For example, $650\mathrm{mg}$ of calcium carbonate, $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$, contains $260\mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium. The same amount of calcium gluconate contains $58\mathrm{mg}$ of elemental calcium.

Quality control (QC) chemists in multivitamin manufacturing analyze raw materials using standardized tests (e.g., US Pharmacopoeia). They prepare samples and standard solutions, then compare them using techniques like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which produces a "fingerprint" spectrum for compound identification. Tablets and capsules are also tested for dissolution and disintegration properties.

**Converting Between Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles**

The relationships among the number of particles, number of moles, and mass of a substance allow conversion between these values.
To convert between particles, moles, and mass:
- Particles to Moles: Divide by Avogadro constant ($N_{\mathrm{A}}$).
- Moles to Mass: Multiply by Molar Mass ($M$).
- Mass to Moles: Divide by Molar Mass ($M$).
- Moles to Particles: Multiply by Avogadro constant ($N_{\mathrm{A}}$).

**Example: Particles to Mass**
What is the mass of $5.67 \times 10^{24}$ molecules of cobalt(II) chloride, $\mathrm{CoCl}_2$?
Molar mass of $\mathrm{CoCl}_2 = 58.93 \mathrm{g/mol} + (2 \times 35.45 \mathrm{g/mol}) = 129.83 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
Mass $= \frac {5 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \mathrm {molecules-CoCl_2}}{6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {molecules-CoCl_2 / mol-CoCl_2}} \times 1 2 9. 8 3 \mathrm {g CoCl_2 / mol-CoCl_2} = 1. 2 2 \times 1 0 ^ {3} \mathrm {g CoCl_2}$.

**Example: Mass to Particles**
How many molecules of iodine chloride, ICl, are contained in a $2.74 \times 10^{-1}$ g sample?
Molar mass of ICl $= 126.90 \mathrm{g/mol} + 35.45 \mathrm{g/mol} = 162.35 \mathrm{g/mol}$.
Moles of ICl $= \frac {2 . 7 4 \times 1 0 ^ {- 1} \mathrm {g}}{1 6 2 . 3 5 \mathrm {g / m o l}} = 1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l}$.
Number of molecules $= (1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l}) \times \frac {(6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s})}{1 \mathrm {m o l}} = 1. 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {2 1} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}$.
