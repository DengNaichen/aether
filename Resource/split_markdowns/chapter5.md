# Counting Atoms and Molecules: The Mole

A recipe for chocolate chip muffins tells you exactly what ingredients you will need. One recipe might call for flour, butter, eggs, milk, vinegar, baking soda, sugar, and chocolate chips. It also tells you how much of each ingredient you will need, using convenient units of measurement. Which of the ingredients do you measure by counting? Which do you measure by volume or by mass? The recipe does not tell you exactly how many chocolate chips or grains of sugar you will need. It would take far too long to count individual chocolate chips or grains of sugar. Instead, the amounts are given in millilitres or grams—the units of volume or mass.

In some ways, chemistry is similar to baking. To carry out a reaction successfully—in chemistry or in baking—you need to know how much of each reactant you will need. When you bake something with vinegar and baking soda, for example, the baking soda reacts with acetic acid in the vinegar to produce carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas helps the batter rise. The chemical equation for this reaction is

$$
\mathrm {N a H C O} _ {3 (\mathrm {s})} + \mathrm {C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O H} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} \rightarrow \mathrm {N a C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O} _ {(\mathrm {a q})} + \mathrm {H} _ {2} \mathrm {O} _ {(\ell)} + \mathrm {C O} _ {2 (\mathrm {g})}
$$

According to the balanced equation, one molecule of baking soda reacts with one molecule of acetic acid to form a salt, water, and carbon dioxide. If you wanted to carry out the reaction, how would you know the amount of baking soda and vinegar to use? Their molecules are much too small and numerous to be counted like eggs.

In this chapter, you will learn how chemists count atoms by organizing large numbers of them into convenient, measurable groups. You will learn how these groups relate the number of atoms in a substance to its mass. Using your calculator and the periodic table, you will learn how to convert between the mass of a substance and the number of atoms it contains.

describe the relationship between isotopic abundance and average atomic mass  
solve problems involving percentage abundance of isotopes and relative atomic mass  
explain the significance of a weighted average  
communicate your understanding of the following terms: isotopic abundance, average atomic mass, mass spectrometer, weighted average

How does the mass of a substance relate to the number of atoms in the substance? To answer this question, you need to understand how the relative masses of individual atoms relate to the masses of substances that you can measure on a balance.

The head of a pin, like the one shown in Figure 5.1, is made primarily of iron. It has a mass of about  $8 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~g}$ , yet it contains about  $8 \times 10^{19}$  atoms. Even if you could measure the mass of a single atom on a balance, the mass would be so tiny (about  $1 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{~g}$  for an iron atom) that it would be impractical to use in everyday situations. Therefore, you need to consider atoms in bulk, not individually.

How do you relate the mass of individual atoms to the mass of a large, easily measurable number of atoms? In the next two sections, you will find out.

Figure 5.1 The head of a typical pin contains about 80 quintillion atoms.

# Relating Atomic Masses to Macroscopic Masses

In Chapter 2, you learned that the mass of an atom is expressed in atomic mass units. Atomic mass units are a relative measure, defined by the mass of carbon-12. According to this definition, one atom of carbon-12 is assigned a mass of  $12\mathrm{u}$ . Stated another way,  $1\mathrm{u} = \frac{1}{12}$  of the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

The masses of all other atoms are defined by their relationship to carbon-12. For example, oxygen-16 has a mass that is  $133\%$  of the mass of carbon-12. Hence the mass of an atom of oxygen-16 is

$$
\frac {1 3 3}{1 0 0} \times 1 2. 0 0 0 \mathrm {u} = 1 6. 0 \mathrm {u}.
$$

Usually, not all the atoms in an element have the same mass. As you learned in Chapter 2, atoms of the same element that contain different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements are made up of two or more isotopes. Chemists need to account for the presence of isotopes when finding the relationship between the mass of a large number of atoms and the mass of a single atom. To understand why this is important, consider the following analogy.

Imagine that you have the task of finding the total mass of 10 000 spoons. If you know the mass of a dessertspoon, can you assume that its mass represents the average mass of all the spoons? What if the 10 000 spoons include soupspoons, dessertspoons, and tablespoons? If you use the mass of a dessertspoon to calculate the total mass of all the spoons, you may obtain a reasonable estimate. Your answer will not be accurate, however, because each type of spoon has a different mass. You cannot calculate an accurate average mass for all the spoons based on knowing the mass of only one type. How can you improve the accuracy of your answer without determining the mass of all the spoons?

![](images/25e096a48e3786698f1ea54de94d3ab1be744a3ae76af3b7319f6d78da918995.jpg)  
Figure 5.2 Think about finding the average mass of a group of objects that have different masses. How is this similar to finding the average mass of an element that is composed of different isotopes?

# Isotopic Abundance

Chemists face a situation similar to the one described above. Because all the atoms in a given element do not have the same number of neutrons, they do not all have the same mass. For example, magnesium has three naturally occurring isotopes. It is made up of  $79\%$  magnesium-24,  $10\%$  magnesium-25, and  $11\%$  magnesium-26. Whether the magnesium is found in a supplement tablet (like the ones on the right) or in seawater as  $\mathrm{Mg(OH)_2}$ , it is always made up of these three isotopes in the same proportion. The relative amount in which each isotope is present in an element is called the isotopic abundance. It can be expressed as a percent or as a decimal fraction. When chemists consider the mass of a sample containing billions of atoms, they must take the isotopic abundance into account.

# CHEM

# FACT

Magnesium plays a variety of roles in the body. It is involved in energy production, nerve function, and muscle relaxation, to name just a few. The magnesium in these tablets, like all naturally occurring magnesium, is made up of three isotopes.

# Average Atomic Mass and the Periodic Table

The average atomic mass of an element is the average of the masses of all the element's isotopes. It takes into account the abundance of each isotope within the element. The average atomic mass is the mass that is given for each element in the periodic table.

It is important to interpret averages carefully. For example, in 1996, the average size of a Canadian family was 3.1. Of course, no one family actually has 3.1 people. In the same way, while the average atomic mass of carbon is  $12.01\mathrm{u}$ , no one atom of carbon has a mass of  $12.01\mathrm{u}$ .

Examine Figure 5.3. Since the atomic mass unit is based on carbon-12, why does the periodic table show a value of  $12.01\mathrm{u}$ , instead of exactly  $12\mathrm{u}$ ? Carbon is made up of several isotopes, not just carbon-12. Naturally occurring carbon contains carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14. If all these isotopes were present in equal amounts, you could simply find the average of the masses of the isotopes. This average mass would be about  $13\mathrm{u}$ , since the masses of carbon-13 and carbon-14 are about  $13\mathrm{u}$  and  $14\mathrm{u}$  respectively.

The isotopes, though, are not present in equal amounts. Carbon-12 comprises  $98.9\%$  of all carbon, while carbon-13 accounts for  $1.1\%$ . Carbon-14 is present in a very small amount—about  $1 \times 10^{-10}\%$ . It makes sense that the average mass of all the isotopes of carbon is 12.01 u—very close to 12—since carbon-12 is by far the predominant isotope.

# CHEM

# FACT

The only elements with only one naturally occurring isotope are beryllium, sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus.

![](images/182d8f25e0a0107a32ecd0ced0249360c758e96186af800f03f10d3b59f00ab3.jpg)  
Figure 5.3 The atomic mass that is given in the periodic table represents the average mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element. It takes into account their isotopic abundances.

Thus chemists need to know an element's isotopic abundance and the mass of each isotope to calculate the average atomic mass. How do chemists determine the isotopic abundance associated with each element? How do they find the mass of each isotope? They use a mass spectrometer, a powerful instrument that generates a magnetic field to obtain data about the mass and abundance of atoms and molecules. You will learn more about the mass spectrometer in Tools & Techniques on page 166. You can use the data obtained with a mass spectrometer to calculate the average atomic mass given in the periodic table.

# Working with Weighted Averages

If you obtain the isotopic abundance of an element from mass spectrometer data or a table, you can calculate the average atomic mass of the element. You do this by calculating the weighted average of each isotope's mass. A weighted average takes into account not only the values associated with a set of data, but also the abundance or importance of each value.

Normally, when you calculate the average of a set of data, you find the equally weighted average. You add the given values and divide the total by the number of values in the set. Each value in the average is given equal weight. For example, imagine that you have three objects: A, B, and C. A has a mass of  $1.0\mathrm{kg}$ , B has a mass of  $2.0\mathrm{kg}$ , and C has a mass of  $3.0\mathrm{kg}$ . Their average mass is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} \frac {\mathrm {M a s s o f (A + B + C)}}{\mathrm {N u m b e r o f i t e m s}} & = \frac {1 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 . 0 \mathrm {k g}}{3} \\ & = 2. 0 \mathrm {k g} \end{array}
$$

What if you have a set containing two of A, one of B, and three of C? Their average mass becomes

$$
\frac {2 (1 . 0 \mathrm {k g}) + 2 . 0 \mathrm {k g} + 3 (3 . 0 \mathrm {k g})}{6} = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}
$$

This is a weighted average.

Another way to calculate the same weighted average is to consider the relative abundance of each object. There are six objects in total. A is present as  $\frac{2}{6}$  (33%) of the total, B is present as  $\frac{1}{6}$  (17%) of the total, and C is present as  $\frac{3}{6}$  (50%) of the total. Thus their average mass can be calculated in the following way:

$$
(0. 3 3) (1. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 1 7) (2. 0 \mathrm {k g}) + (0. 5 0) (3. 0 \mathrm {k g}) = 2. 2 \mathrm {k g}
$$

# Calculating Average Atomic Mass

You can use a similar method to calculate average atomic mass. If you know the atomic mass of each isotope that makes up an element, as well as the isotopic abundance of each isotope, you can calculate the average atomic mass of the element.

For example, lithium exists as two isotopes: lithium-7 and lithium-6. As you can see in Figure 5.4, lithium-7 has a mass of 7.015 u and makes up  $92.58\%$  of lithium. Lithium-6 has a mass of 6.015 u and makes up the remaining  $7.42\%$ . To calculate the average atomic mass of lithium, multiply the mass of each isotope by its abundance.

$$
\left(\frac {9 2 . 5 8}{1 0 0}\right) (7. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) + \left(\frac {7 . 4 2}{1 0 0}\right) (6. 0 1 5 \mathrm {u}) = 6. 9 4 \mathrm {u}
$$

Looking at the periodic table confirms that the average atomic mass of lithium is 6.94 u. The upcoming Sample Problem gives another example of how to calculate average atomic mass.

# mind STRETCH

We use weighted averages all the time! For example, course marks are often based on weighted averages. Suppose that the final mark in a chemistry course is determined as follows: laboratory  $25\%$ , tests  $30\%$ , homework and quizzes  $5\%$ , project  $10\%$ , and final exam  $30\%$ . A student obtains the following marks: laboratory  $\frac{114}{130}$ , tests  $\frac{261}{300}$ , homework and quizzes  $\frac{90}{95}$ , project  $\frac{21}{25}$ , and final exam  $\frac{70}{80}$ . What is the student's final mark in chemistry?

Figure 5.4 Naturally occurring lithium consists of two isotopes,  $^{7}\mathrm{Li}$  and  $^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ .

# The Mass Spectrometer

Many chemists depend on instruments known as mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometers can detect trace pollutants in the atmosphere, provide information about the composition of large molecules, and help to determine the age of Earth's oldest rocks.

As well, mass spectrometers can find the relative abundance of each isotope in an element. In 1912, J.J. Thompson first detected neon-20 and neon-22 in a sample of neon gas by using a magnetic field to separate the isotopes.

Today's mass spectrometers also use a magnetic field to separate the isotopes of an element. Since a magnetic field can only affect the path of a charged particle, the atoms must first be charged, or "ionized." The magnetic field then deflects ions with the same charge, but different masses, onto separate paths. Imagine rolling a tennis ball at a right angle to the air current from a fan. The air current deflects the path of the ball. The same air current deflects a Ping-Pong™ ball more than a tennis ball. Similarly, a magnetic field deflects isotopes of smaller mass more than isotopes of larger mass.

In a mass spectrometer, elements that are not gases are vaporized by heating. Next, the gas atoms are ionized. In electron impact ionization, the gas atoms are bombarded with a stream of electrons from a heated filament. These electrons collide with the gas atoms, causing each atom to lose an electron and become a positive ion.

The ions are focussed and accelerated by electric fields, toward a magnetic field. The magnetic field deflects them and forces them to take a curved path. Lighter ions curve more than heavier ions. Therefore ions from different isotopes arrive at different destinations. Since ions have a charge, a detector can be used to register the current at each destination. The current is proportional to the number of ions that arrive at the destination. An isotope that has a larger relative abundance generates a larger current. From the currents at the different destinations, chemists can deduce the proportion of each isotope in the element.

Mass spectral data for neon, below, show the relative abundance of the isotopes of neon. Using mass spectrometers, chemists now detect a signal from neon-21, in addition to the signals from neon-20 and neon-22.

# Sample Problem

# Average Atomic Mass

# Problem

Naturally occurring silver exists as two isotopes. From the mass of each isotope and the isotopic abundance listed below, calculate the average atomic mass of silver.

<table><tr><td>Isotope</td><td>Atomic mass (u)</td><td>Relative abundance (%)</td></tr><tr><td>10747Ag</td><td>106.9</td><td>51.8</td></tr><tr><td>10947Ag</td><td>108.9</td><td>48.2</td></tr></table>

# What Is Required?

You need to find the average atomic mass of silver.

# What Is Given?

You are given the relative abundance and the atomic mass of each isotope.

# Plan Your Strategy

Multiply the atomic mass of each isotope by its relative abundance, expressed as a decimal. That is,  $51.8\%$  expressed as a decimal is 0.518 and  $48.2\%$  is 0.482.

# Act on Your Strategy

Average atomic mass of  $\mathrm{Ag} = 106.9\mathrm{u}(0.518) + 108.9\mathrm{u}(0.482)$

$$
= 1 0 7. 9 \mathrm {u}
$$

# Check Your Solution

In this case, the abundance of each isotope is close to  $50\%$ . An average atomic mass of about 108 u seems right, because it is between 106.9 u and 108.9 u. Checking the periodic table reveals that the average atomic mass of silver is indeed 107.9 u.

# Practice Problems

1. The two stable isotopes of boron exist in the following proportions:  $19.78\%$ ${}^{10}_{5}\mathrm{B}$  (10.01 u) and  $80.22\%$ ${}^{11}_{5}\mathrm{B}$  (11.01 u). Calculate the average atomic mass of boron.  
2. In nature, silicon is composed of three isotopes. These isotopes (with their isotopic abundances and atomic masses) are  $_{14}^{28}\mathrm{Si}$  ( $92.23\%$ , 27.98 u),  $_{14}^{29}\mathrm{Si}$  ( $4.67\%$ , 28.97 u), and  $_{14}^{30}\mathrm{Si}$  ( $3.10\%$ , 29.97 u). Calculate the average atomic mass of silicon.

# CHEM

# FACT

Why are the atomic masses of individual isotopes not exact whole numbers? After all,  $^{12}\mathrm{C}$  has a mass of exactly 12 u. Since carbon has 6 neutrons and 6 protons, you might assume that protons and neutrons have masses of exactly 1 u each. In fact, protons and neutrons have masses that are close to, but slightly different from, 1 u. As well, the mass of electrons, while much smaller than the masses of protons and neutrons, must still be taken into account.

# CHECKPOINT

Why is carbon-12 the only isotope with an atomic mass that is a whole number?

In some periodic tables, the average atomic mass is referred to as the atomic weight of an element. This terminology, while technically incorrect, is still in use and is generally accepted.

3. Copper is a corrosion-resistant metal that is used extensively in plumbing and wiring. Copper exists as two naturally occurring isotopes:  $^{63}\mathrm{Cu}$  (62.93 u) and  $^{65}\mathrm{Cu}$  (64.93 u). These isotopes have isotopic abundances of 69.1% and 30.9% respectively. Calculate the average atomic mass of copper.  
4. Lead occurs naturally as four isotopes. These isotopes (with their isotopic abundances and atomic masses) are  $^{204}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$  (1.37%, 204.0 u),  $^{206}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$  (26.26%, 206.0 u),  $^{207}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$  (20.82%, 207.0 u), and  $^{208}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$  (51.55%, 208.0 u).

The mass of a Canadian penny has decreased several times over the years. Therefore you can use pennies to represent different "isotopes" of a fictitious element, centium. That is, each "atom" of centium reacts the same way—it is still worth 1¢—but the various isotopes have different characteristic masses.

# Safety Precautions

![](images/da74775aa2c8ba401d7014bd2ecc21b1d4f1b10fadb807a6ea051a51f6d53c35.jpg)

# Procedure

1. Obtain a bag of pennies from your teacher. Since the mass of a penny decreased in 1982 and 1997, your bag will contain pennies dated anywhere from 1982 to the present date.

2. Sort your pennies into groups of pre-1997 "isotopes" and post-1997 "isotopes" of centium.  
3. Count the number of pennies in each group.  
4. Find the mass of ten pennies from each group. Divide the total mass by 10 to get the mass of each centium "isotope."  
5. Use the data you have just gathered to calculate the mass of the pennies, using a weighted average. This represents the "average atomic mass" of centium.

# Analysis

1. In step 4, you used the average mass of ten pennies to represent the mass of one "isotope" of centium.

(a) Why did you need to do this? Why did you not just find the mass of one penny from each group?  
(b) If you were able to find the mass of real isotopes for this experiment, would you need to do step 4? Explain.

2. Compare your "average atomic mass" for centium with the "average atomic mass" obtained by other groups.

(a) Are all the masses the same? Explain any differences.  
(b) What if you were able to use real isotopes of an element, such as copper, for this experiment? Would you expect results to be consistent throughout the class? Explain.

# Calculating Isotopic Abundance

Chemists use a mass spectrometer to determine accurate values for the isotopic abundance associated with each element. Knowing the average atomic mass of an element, you can use the masses of its isotopes to calculate the isotopic abundances.

# Sample Problem

# Isotopic Abundance

# Problem

Boron exists as two naturally occurring isotopes:  ${}^{10}_{5}\mathrm{B}$  (10.01 u) and  ${}^{11}_{5}\mathrm{B}$  (11.01 u). Calculate the relative abundance of each isotope of boron.

# What Is Required?

You need to find the isotopic abundance of boron.

# What Is Given?

Atomic mass of  $\frac{10}{5} \mathrm{~B} = 10.01$  u

Atomic mass of  $\frac{11}{5} \mathrm{~B} = 11.01$  u

From the periodic table, the average atomic mass of boron is  $\mathrm{B} = 10.81\mathrm{u}$ .

# Plan Your Strategy

Express the abundance of each isotope as a decimal rather than a percent. The total abundance of both isotopes is therefore 1. Let the abundance of boron-10 be  $x$ . Let the abundance of boron-11 be  $1 - x$ . Set up an equation, and solve for  $x$ .

# Act on Your Strategy

Average atomic mass  $= x$  (atomic mass B-10) +  $(1 - x)$  (atomic mass B-11)

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1 0. 8 1 = x (1 0. 0 1) + (1 - x) (1 1. 0 1) \\ 1 0. 8 1 = 1 0. 0 1 x + 1 1. 0 1 - 1 1. 0 1 x \\ 1 1. 0 1 x - 1 0. 0 1 x = 1 1. 0 1 - 1 0. 8 1 \\ x = 0. 2 0 0 0 \\ \end{array}
$$

The abundance of boron-10 is 0.2000.

The abundance of boron-11 is  $1 - x$ , or  $1 - 0.2000 = 0.8000$ .

The abundance of  $^{10}\mathrm{B}$  is therefore  $20.00\%$ . The abundance of  $^{11}\mathrm{B}$  is  $80.00\%$ .

# Check Your Solution

The fact that boron-11 comprises  $80\%$  of naturally occurring boron makes sense, because the average atomic mass of boron is 10.81 u.

This is closer to 11.01 u than to 10.01 u.

# CHEM

# FACT

If you wear contact lenses, you may use boron every day. Boron is part of boric acid,  $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{BO}_3$  which is contained in many cleaning solutions for contact lenses.

5. Hydrogen is found primarily as two isotopes in nature:  ${}_{1}^{1}\mathrm{H}$  (1.0078 u) and  ${}_{1}^{2}\mathrm{H}$  (2.0140 u). Calculate the percentage abundance of each isotope based on hydrogen's average atomic mass.  
6. Lanthanum is composed of two isotopes:  $\frac{^{138}La}{57}$  (137.91 u) and  $\frac{^{139}La}{57}$  (138.91 u). Look at the periodic table. What can you say about the abundance of  $\frac{^{138}La}{57}$ ?  
7. Rubidium ignites spontaneously when exposed to oxygen to form rubidium oxide,  $\mathrm{Rb}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ . Rubidium exists as two isotopes:  $^{85}\mathrm{Rb}$  (84.91 u) and  $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$  (86.91 u). If the average atomic mass of rubidium is 85.47 u, determine the percentage abundance of  $^{85}\mathrm{Rb}$ .  
8. Oxygen is composed of three isotopes:  ${}^{16}\mathrm{O}$  (15.995 u),  ${}^{17}\mathrm{O}$  (16.999 u), and  ${}^{18}\mathrm{O}$  (17.999 u). One of these isotopes,  ${}^{17}\mathrm{O}$ , comprises  $0.037\%$  of oxygen. Calculate the percentage abundance of the other two isotopes, using the average atomic mass of 15.9994 u.

# Section Wrap-up

In this section, you learned how isotopic abundance relates to average atomic mass. Since you know the average mass of an atom in any given element, you can now begin to relate the mass of a single atom to the mass of a large number of atoms. First you need to establish how many atoms are in easily measurable samples. In section 5.2, you will learn how chemists group atoms into convenient amounts.

# Section Review

Naturally occurring magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes. These isotopes (with their isotopic abundances and atomic masses) are Mg-24 (78.70%, 23.985 u), Mg-25 (10.13%, 24.985 u), and Mg-26 (11.17%, 25.983 u). Calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium.  
3 C Assume that an unknown element, X, exists naturally as three different isotopes. The average atomic mass of element X is known, along with the atomic mass of each isotope. Is it possible to calculate the percentage abundance of each isotope? Why or why not?  
4 C You know that silver exists as two isotopes: silver-107 and silver-109. However, radioisotopes of silver, such as silver-105, silver-106, silver-108, and silver-110 to silver-117 are known. Why do you not use the abundance and mass of these isotopes when you calculate the average atomic mass of silver? Suggest two reasons.

# The Avogadro Constant and the Mole

In section 5.1, you learned how to use isotopic abundances and isotopic masses to find the average atomic mass of an element. You can use the average atomic mass, found in the periodic table, to describe the average mass of an atom in a large sample.

Why is relating average atomic mass to the mass of large samples important? In a laboratory, as in everyday life, we deal with macroscopic samples. These samples contain incredibly large numbers of atoms or molecules. Can you imagine a cookie recipe calling for six septillion molecules of baking soda? What if copper wire in a hardware store were priced by the atom instead of by the metre, as in Figure 5.5? What if we paid our water bill according to the number of water molecules that we used? The numbers involved would be ridiculously inconvenient. In this section, you will learn how chemists group large numbers of atoms into amounts that are easily measurable.

Figure 5.5 Copper wire is often priced by the metre because the metre is a convenient unit. What unit do chemists use to work with large numbers of atoms?

# Grouping for Convenience

In a chemistry lab, as well as in other contexts, it is important to be able to measure amounts accurately and conveniently. When you purchase headache tablets from a drugstore, you are confident that each tablet contains the correct amount of the active ingredient. Years of testing and development have determined the optimum amount of the active ingredient that you should ingest. If there is too little of the active ingredient, the tablet may not be effective. If there is too much, the tablet may be harmful. When the tablets are manufactured, the active ingredient needs to be weighed in bulk. When the tablets are tested, however, to ensure that they contain the right amount of the active ingredient, chemists need to know how many molecules of the substance are present. How do chemists group particles so that they know how many are present in a given mass of substance?

On its own, the mass of a chemical is not very useful to a chemist. The chemical reactions that take place depend on the number of atoms present, not on their masses. Since atoms are far too small and numerous to count, you need a way to relate the numbers of atoms to masses that can be measured.

In this section, you will

describe the relationship between moles and number of particles  
solve problems involving number of moles and number of particles  
explain why chemists use the mole to group atoms  
communicate your understanding of the following terms: mole, Avogadro constant

When many items in a large set need to be counted, it is often useful to work with groups of items rather than individual items. When you hear the word "dozen," you think of the number 12. It does not matter what the items are. A dozen refers to the quantity 12 whether the items are eggs or pencils or baseballs. Table 5.1 lists some common quantities that we use to deal with everyday items.

Table 5.1 Some Common Quantities  

<table><tr><td>Item</td><td>Quantity</td><td>Amount</td></tr><tr><td>gloves</td><td>pair</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>soft drinks</td><td>six-pack</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>eggs</td><td>dozen</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>pens</td><td>gross (12 dozen)</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>paper</td><td>ream</td><td>500</td></tr></table>

You do not buy eggs one at a time. You purchase them in units of a dozen. Similarly, your school does not order photocopy paper by the sheet. The paper is purchased in bundles of 500 sheets, called a ream. It would be impractical to sell sheets of paper individually.

The term mole is an abbreviation of another word. What do you think this other word is? Check your guess by consulting a dictionary.

# The Definition of the Mole

Convenient, or easily measurable, amounts of elements contain huge numbers of atoms. Therefore chemists use a quantity that is much larger than a dozen or a ream to group atoms and molecules together. This quantity is the mole (symbol mol).

- One mole (1 mol) of a substance contains 6.022 141  $99 \times 10^{23}$  particles of the substance. This value is called the Avogadro constant. Its symbol is  $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ .  
- The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, or formula units) as exactly  $12\mathrm{g}$  of carbon-12.

For example, one mole of carbon contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  atoms of C. One mole of sodium chloride contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  formula units of NaCl. One mole of hydrofluoric acid contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  molecules of HF.

The Avogadro constant is an experimentally determined quantity. Chemists continually devise more accurate methods to determine how many atoms are in exactly  $12\mathrm{g}$  of carbon-12. This means that the accepted value has changed slightly over the years since it was first defined.

# The Chemist's Dozen

The mole is literally the chemist's dozen. Just as egg farmers and grocers use the dozen (a unit of 12) to count eggs, chemists use the mole (a much larger number) to count atoms, molecules, or formula units. When farmers think of two dozen eggs, they are also thinking of 24 eggs.

$$
(2 \mathrm {d o z e n}) \times \left(\frac {1 2 \mathrm {e g g s}}{\mathrm {d o z e n}}\right) = 2 4 \mathrm {e g g s}
$$

Chemists work in a similar way. As you have learned above, 1 mol has  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  particles. Thus 2 mol of aluminum atoms contain  $12.0 \times 10^{23}$  atoms of Al.

$$
2 \mathrm {m o l} \times (6. 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \frac {\mathrm {a t o m s}}{\mathrm {m o l}}) = 1. 2 0 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \mathrm {a t o m s o f A l}
$$

# How Big Is the Avogadro Constant?

The Avogadro constant is a huge number. Its magnitude becomes easier to visualize if you imagine it in terms of ordinary items. For example, suppose that you created a stack of  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  loonies, as in Figure 5.7. To determine the height of the stack, you could determine the height of one loonie and multiply by  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ . The Avogadro constant needs to be this huge to group single atoms into convenient amounts. What does 1 mol of a substance look like? Figure 5.8 shows some samples of elements. Each sample contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  atoms. Notice that each sample has a different mass. You will learn why in section 5.3. Examine the following Sample Problem to see how to work with the Avogadro constant.

# Sample Problem

# Using the Avogadro Constant

# Problem

The distance "as the crow flies" from St. John's in Newfoundland to Vancouver in British Columbia is  $5046\mathrm{km}$ . Suppose that you had 1 mol of peas, each of diameter 1 cm. How many round trips could be made between these cities, laying the peas from end to end?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the number of round trips from St. John's to Vancouver  $(2 \times 5046 \mathrm{~km})$  that can be made by laying  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  peas end to end.

# What Is Given?

Each round trip is  $2 \times 5046$  km or  $10092$  km. A pea has a diameter of  $1$  cm.

# Plan Your Strategy

First convert the round trip distance from kilometres to centimetres. Since each pea has a diameter of  $1\mathrm{cm}$ , a line of  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  peas is  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  cm in length. Divide the length of the line of peas by the round-trip distance to find the number of round trips.

# Act on Your Strategy

Converting the round-trip distance from kilometres to centimetres gives

$$
(1 0 0 9 2 \mathrm {k m}) \times (1 0 ^ {5} \mathrm {c m} / \mathrm {k m}) = 1. 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {9} \mathrm {c m}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {N u m b e r o f r o u n d t r i p s} = \frac {6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {c m} ^ {-}}{\left(1 . 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {9} \mathrm {c m} / \text {r o u n d t r i p}\right)} \\ = 5. 9 6 \times 1 0 ^ {1 4} \mathrm {r o u n d t r i p s} \\ \end{array}
$$

About 596 trillion round trips between St. John's and Vancouver could be made by laying one mole of peas end to end.

# Converting Moles to Number of Particles

In the Thought Lab below, you can practise working with the mole by relating the Avogadro constant to familiar items. Normally the mole is used to group atoms and compounds. For example, chemists know that 1 mol of barium contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  atoms of Ba. Similarly, 2 mol of barium sulfate contain  $2 \times (6.02 \times 10^{23}) = 12.0 \times 10^{23}$  molecules of  $\mathrm{BaSO}_4$ .

number of moles

Multiply by

$6.02 \times 10^{23}$

number of particles (atoms, molecules, formula units)

The mole is used to help us "count" atoms and molecules. The relationship between moles, number of particles, and the Avogadro constant is

$N =$  number of particles

$n =$  number of moles

$N_{\mathrm{A}} = \mathrm{Avogadro~constant}$

$N = n\times N_{\mathrm{A}}$

The term order of magnitude refers to the size of a number—specifically to its exponent when in scientific notation.

How many orders of magnitude is the Avogadro constant greater than one billion?

# Sample Problem

# Moles to Atoms

# Problem

A sample contains  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of nitrogen dioxide,  $\mathrm{NO}_2$

(a) How many molecules are in the sample?  
(b) How many atoms are in the sample?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the number of atoms and molecules in the sample.

# What Is Given?

The sample consists of  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of nitrogen dioxide molecules. Each nitrogen dioxide molecule is made up of three atoms:

1 N atom + 2 O atoms.

$$
N _ {\mathrm {A}} = 6. 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \text {m o l e c u l e s / m o l}
$$

# Plan Your Strategy

(a) A molecule of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$  contains three atoms. Find the number of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$  molecules in  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of nitrogen dioxide.  
(b) Multiply the number of molecules by 3 to arrive at the total number of atoms in the sample.

# Act on Your Strategy

(a) Number of molecules of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = (1. 2 5 \mathrm {m o l}) \times \left(6. 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \frac {\text {m o l e c u l e s}}{\mathrm {m o l}}\right) \\ = 7. 5 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore there are  $7.52 \times 10^{23}$  molecules in  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$

(b)  $(7.52 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{mole}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{u}\mathrm{ules}) \times \left(3 \frac{\mathrm{atoms}}{\mathrm{mole}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{u}\mathrm{ule}}\right) = 2.26 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{atoms}$

Therefore there are  $2.26 \times 10^{24}$  atoms in  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$

# Check Your Solution

Work backwards. One mol contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  atoms. How many moles represent  $2.2 \times 10^{24}$  atoms?

$$
2. 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 4} \text {a t o m s} \times \frac {1 \mathrm {m o l}}{6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \text {a t o m s}} = 3. 7 \mathrm {m o l}
$$

There are 3 atoms in each molecule of  $\mathrm{NO}_2$

$$
3. 7 \mathrm {m o l} \text {a t o m s} \times \frac {1 \mathrm {m o l} \text {m o l e m o c u l e}}{3 \mathrm {m o l} \text {a t o m s}} = 1. 2 \text {m o l e c u l e s}
$$

This is close to the value of  $1.25\mathrm{mol}$  of molecules, given in the question.

Continued.

# Converting Number of Particles to Moles

Chemists very rarely express the amount of a substance in number of particles. As you have seen, there are far too many particles to work with conveniently. For example, you would never say that you had dissolved  $3.21 \times 10^{23}$  molecules of sodium chloride in water. You might say, however, that you had dissolved  $0.533\mathrm{mol}$  of sodium chloride in water. When chemists communicate with each other about amounts of substances, they usually use units of moles (see Figure 5.10). To convert the number of particles in a substance to the number of moles, rearrange the equation you learned previously.

$$
N = N _ {\mathrm {A}} \times n
$$

$$
n = \frac {N}{N _ {\mathrm {A}}}
$$

To learn how many moles are in a substance when you know how many particles are present, find out how many times the Avogadro constant goes into the number of particles.

communicate your understanding of the following term: molar mass

In section 5.2, you explored the relationship between the number of atoms or particles and the number of moles in a sample. Now you are ready to relate the number of moles to the mass, in grams. Then you will be able to determine the number of atoms, molecules, or formula units in a sample by finding the mass of the sample.

# Mass and the Mole

You would never express the mass of a lump of gold, like the one in Figure 5.11, in atomic mass units. You would express its mass in grams. How does the mole relate the number of atoms to measurable quantities of a substance? The definition of the mole pertains to relative atomic mass, as you learned in section 5.1. One atom of carbon-12 has a mass of exactly  $12\mathrm{u}$ . Also, by definition, one mole of carbon-12 atoms  $(6.02\times 10^{23}$  carbon-12 atoms) has a mass of exactly  $12\mathrm{g}$ .

The Avogadro constant is the factor that converts the relative mass of individual atoms or molecules, expressed in atomic mass units, to mole quantities, expressed in grams.

How can you use this relationship to relate mass and moles? The periodic table tells us the average mass of a single atom in atomic mass units (u). For example, zinc has an average atomic mass of 65.39 u. One mole of an element has a mass expressed in grams numerically equivalent to the element's average atomic mass expressed in atomic mass units. One mole of zinc atoms has a mass of 65.39 g. This relationship allows chemists to use a balance to count atoms. You can use the periodic table to determine the mass of one mole of an element.

# What is Molar Mass?

The mass of one mole of any element, expressed in grams, is numerically equivalent to the average atomic mass of the element, expressed in atomic mass units. The mass of one mole of a substance is called its molar mass (symbol  $M$ ). Molar mass is expressed in g/mol. For example, the average atomic mass of gold, as given in the periodic table, is 196.97 u. Thus the mass of one mole of gold atoms, gold's molar mass, is 196.97 g. Table 5.2 gives some additional examples of molar masses.

# Finding the Molar Mass of Compounds

While you can find the molar mass of an element just by looking at the periodic table, you need to do some calculations to find the molar mass of a compound. For example, 1 mol of beryllium oxide, BeO, contains 1 mol of beryllium and 1 mol of oxygen. To find the molar mass of BeO, add the mass of each element that it contains.

$$
\begin{array}{l} M _ {\mathrm {B e O}} = 9. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} + 1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} \\ = 2 5. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Examine the following Sample Problem to learn how to determine the molar mass of a compound. Following Investigation 5-A on the next page, there are some Practice Problems for you to try.

# CHEM

# FACT

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and most other standardization bodies use  $M$  to represent molar mass. You may see other symbols, such as  $mm$ , used to represent molar mass.

# Sample Problem

# Molar Mass of a Compound

# Problem

What is the mass of one mole of calcium phosphate,  $\mathrm{Ca}_3(\mathrm{PO}_4)_2$ ?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the molar mass of calcium phosphate.

# What Is Given?

You know the formula of calcium phosphate. You also know, from the periodic table, the average atomic mass of each atom that makes up calcium phosphate.

# Plan Your Strategy

Find the total mass of each element to determine the molar mass of calcium phosphate. Find the mass of 3 mol of calcium, the mass of 2 mol of phosphorus, and the mass of 8 mol of oxygen. Then add these masses together.

# Act on Your Strategy

$$
M _ {\mathrm {C a}} \times 3 = (4 0. 0 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 3 = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}
$$

$$
M _ {\mathrm {P}} \times 2 = (3 0. 9 7 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 2 = 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}
$$

$$
M _ {\mathrm {O}} \times 8 = (1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}) \times 8 = 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} M _ {\mathrm {C a} _ {3} (\mathrm {P O} _ {4}) _ {2}} = 1 2 0. 2 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 6 1. 9 4 \mathrm {g / m o l} + 1 2 8. 0 0 \mathrm {g / m o l} \\ = 3 1 0. 1 8 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore the molar mass of calcium phosphate is  $310.18\mathrm{g / mol}$

# Check Your Solution

Using round numbers for a quick check, you get

$$
(4 0 \times 3) + (3 0 \times 2) + (1 5 \times 8) = 3 0 0
$$

This estimate is close to the answer of 310.18 g/mol.

# PROBLEM TIP

Once you are used to calculating molar masses, you will want to do the four calculations at left all at once. Try solving the Sample Problem using only one line of calculations.

# Modelling Mole and Mass Relationships

Chemists use the mole to group large numbers of atoms and molecules into manageable, macroscopic quantities. In this way, they can tell how many atoms or molecules are in a given sample, even though the particles are too small to see. In this investigation, you will explore how to apply this idea to everyday objects such as grains of rice and nuts and bolts.

# Question

26. What is the molar mass of the ion  $\left[\mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}$ ?

# Counting Particles Using Mass

Using the mole concept and the periodic table, you can determine the mass of one mole of a compound. You know, however, that one mole represents  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  particles. Therefore you can use a balance to count atoms, molecules, or formula units!

For example, consider carbon dioxide,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . One mole of carbon dioxide has a mass of  $44.0\mathrm{g}$  and contains  $6.02\times 10^{23}$  molecules. You can set up the following relationship:

$6.02 \times 10^{23}$  molecules of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 1$  mol of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow 44.0\mathrm{g}$  of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

How can you use this relationship to find the number of molecules and the number of moles in  $22.0\mathrm{g}$  of carbon dioxide?

Figure 5.12 The molar mass relates the amount of an element or a compound, in moles, to its mass. Similarly, the Avogadro constant relates the number of particles to the molar amount.

# Converting from Moles to Mass

Suppose that you want to carry out a reaction involving ammonium sulfate and calcium chloride. The first step is to obtain one mole of each chemical. How do you decide how much of each chemical you need? You convert the molar amount to mass. Then you use a balance to determine the mass of the proper amount of each chemical.

The following equation can be used to solve problems involving mass, molar mass, and number of moles:

$$
\text {M a s s} = \text {N u m b e r o f m o l e s} \times \text {M o l a r m a s s}
$$

$$
m = n \times M
$$

Write the chemical formulas for calcium chloride and ammonium sulfate. Predict what kind of reaction will occur between them. Write a balanced chemical equation to show the reaction. Ionic compounds containing the ammonium ion are soluble. Ammonium sulfate is soluble, but barium chloride is not.

# Sample Problem

# Moles to Mass

# Problem

A flask contains  $0.750 \, \mathrm{mol}$  of carbon dioxide gas,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . What mass of carbon dioxide gas is in this sample?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the mass of carbon dioxide.

# What Is Given?

The sample contains  $0.750\mathrm{mol}$ . You can determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide from the periodic table.

# Plan Your Strategy

In order to convert moles to grams, you need to determine the molar mass of carbon dioxide from the periodic table.

Multiply the molar mass of carbon dioxide by the number of moles of carbon dioxide to determine the mass.

$$
m = n \times M
$$

# Act on Your Strategy

$$
\begin{array}{l} M _ {\mathrm {C O} _ {2}} = 2 \times (1 6. 0 0 \mathrm {g / m o l}) + 1 2. 0 1 \mathrm {g / m o l} \\ = 4 4. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} m = (0. 7 5 0 \mathrm {m e l}) \times (4 4. 0 1 \mathrm {g} / \mathrm {m e l}) \\ = 3 3. 0 \mathrm {g} \\ \end{array}
$$

The mass of  $0.75\mathrm{mol}$  of carbon dioxide is  $33.0\mathrm{g}$ .

# Check Your Solution

1 mol of carbon dioxide has a mass of  $44\mathrm{g}$ . You need to determine the mass of  $0.75\mathrm{mol}$ , or  $75\%$  of a mole.  $33\mathrm{g}$  is equal to  $75\%$  of  $44\mathrm{g}$ .

You might find the triangle shown in Figure 5.13 useful for problems involving number of moles, number of particles, and molar mass. To use it, cover the quantity that you need to find. The required operation—multiplication or division—will be obvious from the position of the remaining variables. For example, if you want to find the mass of a sample, cover the  $m$  in the triangle. You can now see that

$$
\text {M a s s} = \text {N u m b e r o f m o l e s} \times \text {M o l a r m a s s}.
$$

Be sure to check that your units cancel.

# Converting from Mass to Moles

In the previous Sample Problem, you saw how to convert moles to mass. Often, however, chemists know the mass of a substance but are more interested in knowing the number of moles. Suppose that a reaction produces  $223\mathrm{g}$  of iron and  $204\mathrm{g}$  of aluminum oxide. The masses of the substances do not tell you very much about the reaction. You know, however, that  $223\mathrm{g}$  of iron is  $4\mathrm{mol}$  of iron. You also know that  $204\mathrm{g}$  of aluminum oxide is  $2\mathrm{mol}$  of aluminum oxide. You may conclude that the reaction produces twice as many moles of iron as it does moles of aluminum oxide. You can perform the reaction many times to test your conclusion. If your conclusion is correct, the mole relationship between the products will hold. To calculate the number of moles in a sample, find out how many times the molar mass goes into the mass of the sample.

![](images/9104638bdb5966bef648bae8484090e668655d046627fccd40d3892676166d8d.jpg)

The following Sample Problem explains how to convert from the mass of a sample to the number of moles it contains.

# Sample Problem

# Mass to Moles

# Problem

How many moles of acetic acid,  $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$ , are in a  $23.6\mathrm{g}$  sample?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the number of moles in  $23.6\mathrm{g}$  of acetic acid.

# What Is Given?

You are given the mass of the sample.

# Plan Your Strategy

To obtain the number of moles of acetic acid, divide the mass of acetic acid by its molar mass.

# Act on Your Strategy

The molar mass of  $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COOH}$  is

$$
(1 2. 0 1 \times 2) + (1 6. 0 0 \times 2) + (1. 0 1 \times 4) = 6 0. 0 6 \mathrm {g}.
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} n = \frac {m}{M _ {\mathrm {C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O H}}} \\ n \mathrm {m o l} \mathrm {C H} _ {3} \mathrm {C O O H} = \frac {2 3 . 6 \mathrm {g}}{6 0 . 0 6 \mathrm {g / m o l}} \\ = 0. 3 9 3 \mathrm {m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Therefore there are  $0.393\mathrm{mol}$  of acetic acid in  $23.6\mathrm{g}$  of acetic acid.

# Check Your Solution

Work backwards. There are  $60.06\mathrm{g}$  in each mol of acetic acid. So in  $0.393\mathrm{mol}$  of acetic acid, you have  $0.393\mathrm{mol} \times 60.06\mathrm{g / mol} = 23.6\mathrm{g}$  of acetic acid. This value matches the question.

# Chemical Amounts in Vitamin Supplements

Vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) help to regulate your metabolism. They are the building blocks of blood and bone, and they maintain muscles and nerves. In Canada, a standard called Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) outlines the amounts of micronutrients that people should ingest each day. Eating a balanced diet is the best way to achieve your RNI. Sometimes, however, you may need to take multivitamin supplements when you are unable to attain your RNI through diet alone.

The label on a bottle of supplements lists all the vitamins and minerals the supplements contain. It also lists the form and source of each vitamin and mineral, and the amount of each. The form of a mineral is especially important to know because it affects the quantity your body can use. For example, a supplement may claim to contain  $650\mathrm{mg}$  of calcium carbonate,  $\mathrm{CaCO_3}$ , per tablet. This does not mean that there is  $650\mathrm{mg}$  of calcium. The amount of actual calcium, or elemental calcium, in calcium carbonate is only  $260\mathrm{mg}$ . Calcium carbonate has more elemental calcium than the same amount of calcium gluconate, which only has  $58\mathrm{mg}$  for every  $650\mathrm{mg}$  of the compound. Calcium gluconate may be easier for your body to absorb, however.

# Quality Control

Multivitamin manufacturers employ chemists, or analysts, to ensure that the products they make have the right balance of micronutrients. Manufacturers have departments devoted to quality control (QC). QC chemists analyze all the raw materials in the supplements, using standardized tests. Most manufacturers use tests approved by a "standardization body," such as the US Pharmacopoeia. Such standardization bodies have developed testing guidelines to help manufacturers ensure that their products contain what the labels claim, within strict limits.

To test for quality, QC chemists prepare samples of the raw materials from which they

will make the supplements. They label the samples according to the "lot" of materials from which the samples were taken. They powder and weigh the samples. Then they extract the vitamins. At the same time, they prepare standard solutions containing a known amount of each vitamin.

Next the chemists compare the samples to the standards by subjecting both to the same tests. One test that is used is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC produces a spectrum, or "fingerprint," that identifies each compound. Analysts compare the spectrum that is produced by the samples to the spectrum that is produced by the standard.

Analysts test tablets and capsules for dissolution and disintegration properties. The analyst may use solutions that simulate the contents of the human stomach or intestines for these tests. Only when the analysts are sure that the tablets pass all the necessary requirements are the tablets shipped to retail stores.

# Making Connections

1. Why might consuming more of the daily RNI of a vitamin or mineral be harmful?  
2. The daily RNI of calcium for adolescent females is 700 to  $1100\mathrm{mg}$ . A supplement tablet contains  $950\mathrm{mg}$  of calcium citrate. Each gram of calcium citrate contains  $5.26 \times 10^{-3}$  mol calcium. How many tablets would a 16-year-old female have to take to meet her daily RNI?

An analyst tests whether tablets will sufficiently dissolve within a given time limit.

# Converting Between Moles, Mass, and Number of Particles

You can use what you now know about the mole to carry out calculations involving molar mass and the Avogadro constant. One mole of any compound or element contains  $6.02 \times 10^{23}$  particles. The compound or element has a mass, in grams, that is determined from the periodic table.

Now that you have learned how the number of particles, number of moles, and mass of a substance are related, you can convert from one value to another. Usually chemists convert from moles to mass and from mass to moles. Mass is a property that can be measured easily. The following graphic shows the factors used to convert between particles, moles, and mass. Moles are a convenient way to communicate the amount of a substance.

![](images/2fef8a9b97758e01db3924d2b11a9a100b159e61aaca6c781659012fd989666a.jpg)

For example, suppose that you need  $2.3\mathrm{mol}$  of potassium chloride to carry out a reaction. You need to convert the molar amount to mass so that you can measure the correct amount with a balance.

To be certain you understand the relationship among particles, moles, and mass, examine the following Sample Problem.

# Check Your Solution

$5.67 \times 10^{24}$  molecules is roughly 10 times the Avogadro constant. This means that you have about  $10\mathrm{mol}$  of cobalt(II) chloride. The molar mass of cobalt(II) chloride is about  $130\mathrm{g}$ , and 10 times  $130\mathrm{g}$  is  $1300\mathrm{g}$ .

What if you wanted to compare amounts of substances, and you only knew their masses? You would probably convert their masses to moles. The Avogadro constant relates the molar amount to the number of particles. Examine the next Sample Problem to learn how to convert mass to number of particles.

# Sample Problem

# Mass to Particles

# Problem

Chlorine gas,  $\mathrm{Cl}_2$ , can react with iodine,  $\mathrm{I}_2$ , to form iodine chloride, ICl. How many molecules of iodine chloride are contained in a  $2.74 \times 10^{-1}$  g sample?

# What Is Required?

You need to find the number of molecules in  $2.74 \times 10^{-1}$  g of iodine.

# What Is Given?

You are given the mass of the sample.

Continued.

# Plan Your Strategy

First convert the mass to moles, using the molar mass of iodine. Multiplying the number of moles by the Avogadro constant will yield the number of molecules.

# Act on Your Strategy

The molar mass of ICl is 162.36 g.

Dividing the given mass of ICl by the molar mass gives

$$
\begin{array}{l} n = \frac {2 . 7 4 \times 1 0 ^ {- 1} \mathrm {g}}{1 6 2 . 3 6 \mathrm {g / m o l}} \\ = 1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l} \\ \end{array}
$$

Now multiply the number of moles by the Avogadro constant. This gives the number of molecules in the sample.

$$
(1. 6 9 \times 1 0 ^ {- 3} \mathrm {m o l}) \times \frac {(6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s})}{1 \mathrm {m o l}} = 1. 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {2 1} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}
$$

Therefore there are  $1.01 \times 10^{21}$  molecules in  $2.74 \times 10^{-1}$  g of iodine chloride.

# Check Your Solution

Work backwards. Each mole of iodine chloride has a mass of  $162.36 \, \mathrm{g/mol}$ . Therefore  $1.01 \times 10^{21}$  molecules of iodine chloride have a mass of:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 1. 0 1 \times 1 0 ^ {2 1} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s} \times \frac {1 \mathrm {m o l}}{6 . 0 2 \times 1 0 ^ {2 3} \mathrm {m o l e c u l e s}} \times \frac {1 6 2 . 3 6 \mathrm {g}}{1 \mathrm {m o l}} \\ = 2. 7 2 \times 1 0 ^ {- 1} \mathrm {g} \\ \end{array}
$$

The answer is close to the value given in the question. Your answer is reasonable.
